=== What is _EQL_?
The EITCO query language provides a unified interface for searches. Hence, this documentation addresses developers, mainly those who use java (or any JVM compatible language). However, there is also a port for Typescript.

EQL is agnostic of the actual implementation of the search. While still a lot of searches are made on classical relational databases, more and more are executed on NoSQL databases. The language EQL is independent of the actual search implementation, however, there are some specifics that will only work for specific search implementations. Currently, there are implementations for SQL, in-memory searches and Solr.


There are several ways to search using EQL. All have a common entry point: `de.eitco.commons.query.language.api.SearchService`.
