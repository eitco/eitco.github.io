<h3 id="_headless_content_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_headless_content_services"></a><a class="link" href="#_headless_content_services">Headless Content Services</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The market for "headless systems" has been growing for some time.
These offer backend functions without a user interface of the system completely
can be used by the end user.
This is best known from content management systems (CMS) used in web development.
With the increasing use of different end devices such as smartphones, tablets or wearables, they are increasing
also the requirements for content management systems. In addition, users have a lot of content on different channels.
Headless CMS dispense with the front end and thus enable your content to be displayed
various channels through a single REST API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if products are to be fully and seamlessly integrated in a platform and
a dependency on a user interface or client is no longer desired,
one speaks of so-called "headless systems".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wide availability of different cloud services and solutions enables the set up
a modern platform for your business processes. Instead of relying on a monolithic ECM as before,
companies combine the most suitable cloud content services and create with the "best-of-breed"
Approach targeted added value for your digital company platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of whether you have your own solution, an open cloud application or your company portal, want to add secure and legally compliant ECM functions:
You can access all of your data directly via a single interface (REST API),
Access documents and information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>arveo</em> is headless by design. All modules are hosted as pure backend cloud services
from Eitco or optionally hybrid in your private cloud or on-premises in your data center
disposal. Of course, these are natively suitable for mobile applications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_api_first"><a class="anchor" href="#_api_first"></a><a class="link" href="#_api_first">API first</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The stateless REST API is our product and is used by all <em>arveo</em> components and user interfaces. The web services are stable over the long term and are fully available to every customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to us that our services have open interfaces and can be easily integrated into an enterprise service infrastructure.
As a modern content services platform, the <em>arveo</em> uses standards wherever
possible in order to use the steadily growing number of cloud-enabled services inside or outside the company infrastructure. Whether operating system, database, text recognition, machine learning or object storage, <em>arveo</em> can access services from different manufacturers and combine them with its own services in order to quickly create added value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_best_of_breed_strategy"><a class="anchor" href="#_best_of_breed_strategy"></a><a class="link" href="#_best_of_breed_strategy">Best-Of-Breed strategy</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many ECM products and the market is constantly changing. A manufacturer-independent ECM standard such as SQL
for relational databases has not fully established itself for ECM applications despite several attempts from WebDAV to
JSR 170 to CMIS. The market is dominated by monolithic packages that master all ECM applications.
A customer who implements a complex ECM application for his company often becomes highly dependent on a manufacturer and is faced with costs that
are difficult to calculate when changing providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the availability of platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, which make a wide variety of services easily usable via web services, we are seeing a change in the behavior of companies who want to buy fewer complete solutions and instead are looking for specialized services that can easily be combined and thus create targeted added value for the digital company platform.
Companies choose the best features from different manufacturers and combine them to create
their own solutions, whereby you control the services used via your own API management or API gateways. This creates company platforms that not only access one, but often several repositories.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Best-Of-Breed strategy</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This often called Best-Of-Breed strategy benefits from the fact that the services available in the marketplaces have become increasingly standardized in recent years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>arveo</em> consistently relies on a microservice architecture. The individual services are loosely connected
to one another via lightweight stateless web service interfaces (http, REST) and each service can run and scale
independently. All <em>arveo</em> functions are available via a uniform REST API gateway,
which also takes care of the intelligent load distribution and the detection of defective services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scalability"><a class="anchor" href="#_scalability"></a><a class="link" href="#_scalability">Scalability</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern cloud-ready platforms rely on horizontal scaling and the load is distributed over many nodes, which can consist of inexpensive commodity hardware. Such a structure can also save costs through automated SCALE OUT and DOWN by switching nodes on or off as required. The <em>arveo</em> platform has a high tolerance for the failure of individual nodes. A high-performance availability is also required, since the end user nowadays only shows a limited understanding of long response times and can quickly switch to the competition in case of doubt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All <em>arveo</em> services support containerized deployment and use stateless REST APIs so that they can be easily integrated into any cloud infrastructure.
Through the use of containerized applications (Docker) and the service management of the open source Spring Framework, which well-known providers such as Netflix use and continuously improve, the services can be installed automatically as often as required and thus scale out and down if you use the cloud orchestration framework kubernetes.
You can cluster together linux containers and build an auto-scaling and high available platform with high fail safety.
A blue-green deployment for the risk-free, downtime-free rollout of new software versions is also possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_future_proof"><a class="anchor" href="#_future_proof"></a><a class="link" href="#_future_proof">Future proof</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our services use standards as far as possible, so that services from different providers can be delivered without great integration effort and the customer can react quickly to changes in the market. Due to the secure web service interfaces, all services including the database can be obtained from the cloud at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <em>arveo</em> services, you can build a sustained system architecture. By design <em>arveo</em> will you allow to separate your business logic from <em>arveo</em>
ECM standard services and all other available cloud services like OCR, AI,
document conversion (e.g. to PDF), identity management. <em>arveo</em> solutions are designed to be manufacturer-independent, so that the underlying REST ECM and other services can be exchanged at easily calculable costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach makes it possible to exchange individual services through to the content services of the <em>arveo</em> with little and easily calculable effort. Even <em>arveo</em> ECM services can be replaced by comparable services and via an open source S3 connector supplied, third-party systems can access the content objects migration-free using the S3 standard API.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>arveo</em> is a native cloud platform and is based on Open Source libraries and services. Through the consistent microservice architecture and the use of open source cloud technology, you can keep <em>arveo</em>'s operating costs low.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages of <em>arveo</em> operation</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All services are horizontally scalable separately and can therefore also be operated on simple hardware. <em>arveo</em> runs on all Linux and Windows operating systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No additional license costs due to the consistent use of open source technology such as Linux,
postgreSQL 12 and apache solr 8.6 NoSQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Container deployment: Simple integration into existing cloud platforms enables load-dependent,
automated service provision up to blue-green deployment for seamless updates to new software versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hybrid architecture: Flexible use of cloud services or on-premise services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low manufacturer dependency: By separating the user interface and business logic from the ECM / BPM services while using standards such as REST, S3 or BPMN2, there is less dependency on one manufacturer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web applications: We deliver templates for PWA (Progressive Web Apps) based on the state-of-the-art angular framework, which are completely open source. I.e. their surfaces belong to you and can be used independently of <em>arveo</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of standards: Low training costs and high availability of know-how on the market through the use of standard frameworks (angular), standard interfaces (REST, S3, SAP Archive Link) and SDKs for Javascript, JAVA, C #.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud is a collection of additional Spring components that provide the typical functionality required in a
distributed or cloud application. The individual components can be used independently of one another and partly consist
of integrable dependencies as well as independent applications. Which of the Spring Cloud components are used therefore
depends entirely on the project requirements. Spring Cloud applications can be operated in managed cloud environments
such as Cloud Foundry.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring Cloud Config offers a central configuration service as well as a client library for components that consume the
configuration. In a Spring Boot application, it is sufficient to add the corresponding dependency. From then on, Spring
will automatically read from the configuration service if it is available. The configuration data can be stored in simple
files, in a database, a Git repository or in a protected repository such as Vault.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the proper use of the <em>arveo</em> and 3rd party services, we recommend implementing these measures when using <em>Eitco</em> as compliant repository for legally compliant storage of records and documents.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow users and 3rd party applications to identify and find objects in <em>arveo</em> you should define a unique and immutable unique identifier property (<a href="../arveo-developer#<em>type_annotations">Data Modelling</a>).
The property must be _@Unique</em> to ensure that a user or business application can clearly identify the item.
The unique identifier should use the taxonomy of business processes and contain all information to clearly recognize the document.
Make the property <em>@Readonly</em> to ensure that the identifier is always set and immutable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The minimizes the risk of incorrect indexing and undetectability of documents because the index is immutable, duplicate identifiers are rejected and the compliant taxonomy ensures that every user can find documents easy and fast. We strongly recommend building a documented, simple but clear taxonomy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your business application or the user must set the value when the object is created (<em>@Mandatory</em> annotation), or you can let <em>arveo</em> create a unique value by adding counter annotations.
Add the <em>@Autoincrement</em> annotation if a simple sequential Long id meets your requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need a more sophisticated unique identifier you can use the annotation _@FormattedCounter which allows you to create e.g. String identifiers like &lt;year&gt;-&lt;sequence&gt; (<a href="../arveo-developer#_formatted_counters_example"><strong>Unique Identifier Example</strong></a>)</p>

<p><em>arveo</em> distinguishes three kinds of data and stores each to the most suitable storage system.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Content: <em>arveo</em> stores unstructured content like documents, audio, video and images to
either a cloud object storage or a file system storage.<br>
Most cloud providers like AWS S3, NetAPP ONTAP, EMC Elastic Cloud, etc. provide file system storage or object storage systems.
Object storages are organized in buckets and allow you to store an almost unlimited numbers of objects in a bucket.
<em>arveo</em> accesses the content via REST Standard S3.<br>
For an optimized and fast access of often used content objects <em>arveo</em> can integrate a NoSQL Keyvalue
Cache DB like redis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured system properties: containing all primary keys and technical information
about documents, containers and folders. The data has a fix data model and requires highest performance, consistency and
transaction support. <em>arveo</em> saves the data on a relational database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer specific metadata: The data model is different for each document, container or folder type. This metadata is
semi structured and new properties might be added during the life cycle of the application.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eventually consistent customer information: Sometimes the consistency of the data is not important, but we must guarantee a high performance and facets support when we filter by any value without the risk of a full table scan.

<p>Consistency: All clients see the same content and metadata.</p>
