To access the audit, the audit service provides a REST API. Access will be restricted to users with the authority AUDITOR.","title":"Configure Audit","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"audit","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/audit.html","titles":[{"text":"Access audit","hash":"access_audit","id":1}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"All arveo services require authentication, ensuring that only another arveo service or an authenticated user can use the REST API. Authentication of a user is done by an authentication service like Keycloak using OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect. This chapter describes how arveo's content services act as an OAuth2.0 resource server for applications using the arveo REST API how the arveo services use OAuth2.0 to authenticate to other services as a technical user. All content services use Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. The services support OAuth2.0 with OpenID Connect. An arveo service can take the role of an OAuth2.0 resource server and/or a client. Services acting as a client perform authenticated requests to other services, using the authentication service to retrieve an access token. OAuth2.0 defines four flows to get an access token. These flows are called grant types. arveo supports the following flows for user authentication and service authentication. Client Credentials Flow: used for machine-to-machine service communication. Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) technique: used by arveo Web Applications sand also used by mobile apps. Resource Owner Password Flow: can be used by highly-trusted apps. To connect the arveo services to an authentication service that supports OAuth2.0, the issuer URI of the authentication service must be configured. Required configuration properties like OAuth2.0 endpoints and public keys will be discovered automatically. If the authentication service does not support auto discovery of configuration options, the required settings can be set manually using the configuration options of Spring Security. The following example shows a configuration for an arveo service acting as a resource-server using Keycloak. resource-server configuration using JSON web tokens spring: security: oauth2: resourceserver: jwt: issuer-uri: \"https://keyloak.example.com/realms/MyRealm\" In case the authentication service uses opaque tokens instead of JSON web tokens, the configuration would look as shown in the next example. In this case, the URI of the token introspection endpoint of the authentication service must be configured. resource-server configuration using opaque tokens spring: security: oauth2: resourceserver: opaquetoken: introspection-uri: \"https://authentication.example.com/oauth2/introspect\" client-id: \"opaque-client\" client-secret: \"secret\" If the service will communicate with other services, it acts as a resource-server and a client. Therefore, an oauth client must be configured as well. The following example shows a client configuration using the client_credentials grant type for service to service communication: resource-server and client configuration spring: security: oauth2: resourceserver: jwt: issuer-uri: \"https://keyloak.example.com/realms/MyRealm\" client: registration: keycloak-client-credentials: provider: keycloak client-id: \"myclient\" client-secret: \"BatqOpzPlIksUsqeZjgxcbAgrA0PQuFM\" authorization-grant-type: \"client_credentials\" provider: keycloak: issuer-uri: \"https://keyloak.example.com/realms/MyRealm\" The arveo services retrieve required information about the user from the access token. The authentication of the user is done by validating the signature of the JSON web token (JWT) or by introspecting the opaque token submitted in the request. Authorization- and additional information of the user like name, e-mail or custom attributes are retrieved from the access token’s claims. Each arveo service checks the audience (aud) claim of a JWT to ensure that the user is authorized to access the service. The aud claim must contain the service’s name. The following table contains the names of the services. audiences Service Name Content Repository Service content-repository-service Audit Service audit-service Document Conversion Service document-conversion-service TUS Upload Service tus-upload-service User rights are read from the scope claim and from a custom claim called authorities. Some services require specific authorities for some features. The required authorities are listed in the service’s documentation. It is possible to limit the access to a specific service by defining an additional mandatory user right. This can be enabled using the property security.general.role-for-secured-access. The information read from the access token can be used in ABAC security methods to check a user’s access rights. Sometimes the information in the access tokens might not be sufficient. For example, information about a user’s group memberships might be too big to be stored in an access token. For situations like this, the OpenID Connect (OIDC) user information endpoint can be used to load additional information about a user. Information loaded using OIDC is added to the security context and is available in ABAC security methods, too. To activate this feature, the following configuration parameter must be set: enabling OIDC commons: security: oauth2: external-user-management: oidc: fetch-user-info: true By default, the URI of the user info endpoint is determined automatically by using the configured issuer URL of the resource-server configuration. Alternatively, the issuer URI for the OIDC lookup can be configured as shown below: configuring the issuer-uri commons: security: oauth2: external-user-management: oidc: fetch-user-info: true issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:12345\" The information loaded from the user info endpoint is cached to avoid frequent requests to the authentication service. By default, the cache entries are kept for 60 minutes. The configuration properties section for the group commons.security.oauth2 contains information about how to change the caching parameters. Services that require a unique ID of a user use the value of the subject (sub) claim of a JWT or the name attribute of the token introspection response in case opaque tokens are used. The content repository service requires a unique 64 bit integer ID for each user. There are different ways of how to assign these internal IDs to a user. By default, the content repository service assumes that the authentication service is not able to assign numerical IDs and assigns a unique numerical ID to each user when the user performs the first request to the service. The assigned IDs are stored in a database table called cmn_external_users. The external ID used in the mapping is read from the subject claim of the token by default. If another claim contains the external ID, the name of this claim must be configured using the property commons.security.oauth2.external-user-management.database-id-resolver.external-id-claim. The automatic assignment of internal IDs can be deactivated as shown below: deactivating automatic internal ID assignment commons: security: oauth2: external-user-management: database: enabled: false The service will then try to get a numeric ID for the user from the access token by checking for the claim configured in commons.security.oauth2.external-user-management.token-id-resolver.id-claim. By default, the claim user-id will be used. It must contain a value that can be parsed to java.lang.Long. Neither the internal nor the external ID is suitable to be displayed in a client (for example, in a version history view). For this purpose arveo can add an external identifier to a user. These additional identifiers are stored in the same database table as the assigned internal IDs. By default, the external identifiers are read from the user’s token at the first login. For both JWTs and opaque tokens, the preferred_username claim (or principal attribute) is used. The claim or attribute to use can be configured using the properties commons.security.oauth2.additional-identifier-resolver.claim-name (for JWTs) or the property commons.security.oauth2.additional-identifier-resolver.principal-attribute-name (for opaque tokens). A client can access the additional identifiers in the ModificationInformation returned for each entity: accessing additional identifiers AdditionalUserIdentifiers additionalUserIdentifiers = entity.getModificationInformation().getAdditionalUserIdentifiers(); String creationUserIdentifier = additionalUserIdentifiers.getCreationUserIdentifier(); String initialCreationUserIdentifier = additionalUserIdentifiers.getInitialCreationUserIdentifier(); String modificationUserIdentifier = additionalUserIdentifiers.getModificationUserIdentifier(); Note that each of the returned strings might be null depending on the availability of additional identifiers. Keycloak is the recommended authentication and authorization service to be used for arveo. Setup and configuration is covered by the Keycloak documentation. This section contains some best practices and recommendations. Keycloak uses realms to separate environments. It is recommended to create a separate realm for arveo. The signature algorithm used for the tokens should be RS256, which currently is the default value in Keycloak. Access to the services and client applications can be controlled by Keycloak clients. Each client should be used for one service or client application. For example, a separate client for service-to-service communication should be created. This must be a confidential client (requiring a client secret) that does only support the client_credentials flow. A client for application-to-service communication does not need to be confidential and should support the authorization_code and/or the resource_owner_password flow. By default, Keycloak will add several attributes of a user to an issed token like the user’s unique ID in the sub claim. Additional required claims like aud (audience) can be set using token mappers. Keycloak can act as an intermediate between Microsoft Active Directory (using user federation) and Azure Entra ID (using an identity provider). User data will be managed in Active Directory or Entra ID while Keycloak will issue tokens for the services and client applications. User federation with Active Directory can be achieved by setting up an LDAP synchronization as described in the Keycloak documentation. Single sign on using the Windows credentials is possible using Kerberos. LDAP roles (or groups) can be mapped to Keycloak realm roles using an LDAP Role mapper as described in the Keycloak documentation. This can be used to assign access rights to specific parts or entities of the archive to a user by assigning the user to specific LDAP groups. When importing LDAP roles, make sure to configure a suitable filter. Otherwise, Keycloak will map all roles, which might take a long time. The LDAP roles that were mapped to realm roles can then be used in a token mapper of type realm role. For example, these roles can be mapped to the authorities claim of the access token and then used in ABAC functions. It is possible to map realm roles to authorities with a different name. That makes it possible to change the name of a required authority without having to change the name of the LDAP group or the realm role. Azure Entra ID must be added as a generic OpenID Connect 1.0 provider as described in the Keycloak documentation. The predefined social login template for Microsoft Azure does not offer the required customization options. All that is required in Entra ID is an app registration for Keycloak with the redirect URI shown in the Keycloak admin UI. The client ID is shown in the overview page of the client registration in Entra ID. Client secrets can be managed in the certificates and secrets section of the client registration. The client registration requires an API permission to be able to sign in and read a user’s profile. Add the following API permission to the app registration: Microsoft Graph / User.Read. By default, Keycloak will use it’s internal UUID of an imported user for the sub claim in the issued tokens. It is recommended to use the object ID of the user in Azure instead. Add a mapper of type Attribute Importer to the OpenID Connect identity provider that maps the oid claim to a user attribute called oid. To get access to the oid claim, the Scopes setting of the identity provider must be set to openid profile. Then configure a token mapper to add this user attribute to a token claim called oid in the Keycloak client(s). Now Keycloak will add the user’s oid to a token claim named oid. If you use the client_credentials flow or if you already have created users in Keycloak manually, these users and the service account user for the technical client must have the oid attribute, too. This can be done in the user settings. The user for the service account role can be found in the client properties under Service Account Roles. The last step is to configure arveo to use the oid claim to get the user’s external id. Add the following setting to the configuration: commons: security: oauth2: external-user-management: database-id-resolver: external-id-claim: oid","title":"OAuth2.0 authentication and authorization","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"authentication-oauth2","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/authentication-oauth2.html","titles":[{"text":"OAuth2.0 Flows (Grant types)","hash":"oauth2_0_flows_grant_types","id":1},{"text":"Connecting arveo services to an authentication service using OAuth2.0","hash":"connecting_arveo_services_to_an_authentication_service_using_oauth2_0","id":2},{"text":"Access tokens and OpenID Connect","hash":"access_tokens_and_openid_connect","id":3},{"text":"User IDs","hash":"user_ids","id":4},{"text":"Additional identifiers","hash":"additional_identifiers","id":5},{"text":"Keycloak","hash":"keycloak","id":6},{"text":"Using Active Directory or Entra ID","hash":"using_active_directory_or_entra_id","id":7},{"text":"LDAP","hash":"ldap","id":8},{"text":"Mapping LDAP roles to realm roles","hash":"mapping_ldap_roles_to_realm_roles","id":9},{"text":"Entra ID","hash":"entra_id","id":10}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"An X.509 certificate is a digital certificate that uses the widely accepted international X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) standard to verify that a public key belongs to the user, computer or service identity contained within the certificate. The X.509 authentication is based on encrypted communication between client and server using SSL or TLS. When establishing the encrypted connection, the server requests a certificate from the client and validates it. Only if this validation is successful, the connection is established. The client certificate data can then be used by the application to authenticate the user. Each client must therefore be issued its own certificate. Since validation of the certificate is already performed by the server when the connection is established, a service cannot offer open endpoints that do not require authentication, unlike when using OAuth2, for example. Furthermore, it should be noted that the client certificate cannot be forwarded to other services. Thus, if the service needs to send requests to other authenticated services, another certificate or an authentication mechanism such as OAuth2 must be used for authentication at the downstream services. X.509 is therefore particularly suitable for internal services such as importers that access the arveo service directly, and for additional security in a service landscape for clients that already use another authentication mechanism. The X.509 authentication mechanism can be activated as shown in the following example: Enabling X.509 authentication server: ssl: key-store-type: PKCS12 key-store: /path/keyStore.p12 key-store-password: changeit trust-store-type: JKS trust-store: /path/trustStore.jks trust-store-password: changeit client-auth: need security: x509: enabled: true In the above example, a PKCS12 keystore is configured for the server certificate and a JKS trust-store for validating the client certificates. With client-auth: need the server is instructed to request a certificate from the client (Spring documentation). The OAuth2 authentication mechanism must be deactivated by setting the following configuration properties: Disabling OAuth2 spring: security: oauth2: resourceserver: enabled: false It is possible to use the SSL client certificate validation as an additional security layer while still authenticating the user using OAuth2 by setting security.x509.enabled=false and leaving OAuth2 enabled. To notify other services or clients using the Registry Service to use SSL for arveo instances, the Eureka service registry client of the registered service must be configured to register the HTTPS URL of the arveo service in the registry as shown below: registering HTTPS URLs in the service registry eureka: instance: nonSecurePortEnabled: false securePortEnabled: true To extract the name of the user from the certificate, a regular expression is used to parse the subject of the certificate. By default, the value of the CN property is used for the username. This behavior can be influenced by defining your own regular expression. The regular expression must define exactly one group with the desired value. Property Purpose Default value security.x509.user-pattern Defines the regular expression to determine the user CN=(.*?)(?:,|$) To be able to access the arveo services from a client application or to authenticate requests from one arveo service to another with X.509, an appropriately configured HTTP client must be used. Both the Java Client SDK and the services provide configuration properties to enable X.509 for the HTTP client: Enabling X.509 for the HTTP client http: client: ssl: key-store: /path/service-user.p12 key-store-type: PKCS12 key-store-password: changeit client-auth: true protocol: TLSv1.2 security: x509: client: enabled: true Here the HTTP client is assigned a PKCS12 keystore with the client certificate and the X.509 authentication is enabled.

The following example shows how to use OpenSSL to generate a pair of self-signed certificates for client and service.

With openssl you can do this e.g. with the following parameter: -addext \"subjectAltName = DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1\" In order for the server’s certificate to be accepted by the client, it must be made known to Java as a trusted certificate.

A Document in the repository can contain several content elements. For example, a document could contain a content element with the original content (like a TIFF image or a Word document) and a PDF rendition. Each content element has a contentName and some more properties like the media type. The contentName is a label that uniquely identifies a single content element contained in a Document. For example, a Document might contain two content elements that are identified by the contentNames 'content' and 'rendition'. The contentNames are not only relevant for uniquely identifying a content element contained in a document, but serve as reference for further customization of the repository. The repository does accept configuration options that are directly related to contentNames and the Document type definitions define restrictions regarding the allowed contentNames. Type definitions define which contentNames can be contained in the entities stored in the definition. Each content element is stored in a storage profile, which defines the place where the actual content will be stored. The contentType parameter can be used to define what kind of content a content element can contain. When the media type is set to application/octet-stream, any kind of content can be used. The name of a content element must start with a letter and can consist only of letters (upper- and lower-case), numbers and the _ character. More formally, the name must match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*. It is specified in the type definition, which content elements this type definition may have. Usually, the content elements of the entities are stored in a JSON field in the database which contains the storage-ID and additional metadata like size, media type and a hash. The actual content data is not stored in the JSON field. If required, a content element can also be stored in a separate field of type text. The separate field will contain only the storage-ID but no additional metadata. Additional metadata for content elements using separate fields have to be handled by the client application, for example by storing them in a custom metadata attribute. The following example is an object of type Document, for which two content elements are defined: \"content\" and \"LARGE_CONTENT\". In this example, \"separateField = true\" means a separate column in the database, otherwise it is written in the corresponding json field of the database. The name of a separate column in the database is derived from the name of the content element. Example of a Document with two content elements @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = \"content\", separateField = true) @ContentElement(name = \"LARGE_CONTENT\", separateField = true) public interface TwoContentsDocument { @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) DocumentId getId(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CONTENT) Map<String, ContentInformation> getContentInformation(); String getName(); void setName(String name); } Using the contentType attribute of the @ContentElement annotation one can define the required content type for a content element. The content type application/octet-stream is used as a wildcard type for any type of content. For example, if the value of the contentType attribute is set to application/pdf, only PDF files can be stored in the content element. It is possible to define the content type of a new content element when it is uploaded. The server will trust this information, so the client is responsible to send the correct content type. If the client does not define the content type, the server will automatically detect the content type of the uploaded binary data. If a type definition of type DOCUMENT does not contain any @ContentElement annotations, the server will automatically assign a content element with the name content to it. This content element’s metadata will be stored in the JSON field of the type definition and it accepts any kind of content type. The following Table contains an Overview of the available attributes of the @ContentElement annotation. Attributes of the ContentElement annotation Attribute Default value Explanation name The name of the content element. This attribute is mandatory. profile The name of the storage profile used to store the content element. This attribute is optional. contentType application/octet-stream The type of content supported by the content element. separateField false Whether to store only the content ID and no additional metadata in a separate database field. fulltextExtraction false If true, the fulltext content of the content element will be extracted and stored in the database. A StorageProfile defines on which storage the content elements are saved. Access to the storage backends (like filesystem or S3) is handled by storage plugins. A StoragePlugin is defined in the StorageProfile, which is used to access the connected storage. The same plugin can be used in several StorageProfiles. Each StorageProfile can have a different set of parameters (access data, URls, …​) for the plugin. StorageProfile definition ecr: server: storage: profiles: fileSystemProfile: (1) defaultProfile: true (4) pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin (2) pluginSettings: (3) storagePath: /storage s3Profile: (1) pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.s3.S3Plugin (2) pluginSettings: (3) pathStyleAccessEnabled: true serviceEndpoint: \"http://localhost:49999\" region: us-west-2 accessKey: myaccesskey secretAccessKey: mysecretaccesskey bucket: testbucket 1 profile name 2 class name of the plugin 3 plugin specific configuration data like the path for the filesystem plugin or the bucket for the S3 plugin 4 defines this profile as the default profile (see Mapping content elements to storage profiles) Each profile is identified by name and defines the storage plugin to use. Plugin-specific settings can be configured in the pluginSettings map. So the plugin class name determines the storage technology and the plugin settings. Do not rename a storage profile after data was stored in it. The name of the profile is part of the identifier of a content element. Renaming the profile would make it impossible to load the data stored in it. If a content element has been saved using the named StoragePlugin, the plugin defined in the profile will return a contentID, with which the stored data can be retrieved later. This id, which is usually of type String, is saved with the document. It is a task of the storage plugin to implement, which contents this id has. Usually it is a UUID, but it may also be a text string. A plugin is assigned to each profile based on the fully qualified class name. Any name-value pairs can be specified for the configuration of the plug-in. The profiles are identified by their name. It is possible to assign aliases to storage profile names. This might be required when storage profiles are mapped to content elements by configuration as described below. Assigning aliases can be done in the configuration by defining alias: profileName entries as shown below: Storage profile aliases ecr: server: storage: profile-aliases: alias1: encryptedProfile another_alias: encryptedProfile It is possible to define more than one alias for a storage profile. Aliases are resolved before a content element is saved. The resulting ContentId will contain the resolved profile, not the alias name. The bucket selector plugin does not support aliases when selection rules are evaluated. There are two ways to map a specific content element to a storage profile. To define the mapping of the content elements to storage profiles in the application code, the storage profile name can be set in the @ContentElement annotation using the profile attribute. Defining the storage profile of a content element in the code @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = \"content\", profile = \"fileSystemProfile\") public interface MyDocument { } The example above shows a document type with a single named content element that will be stored in a storage profile called fileSystemProfile. If the mapping should be controlled by the configuration and not be defined in the code, storage profiles with auto- matchable names must be used. The matching is based on the name of the type definition (in snake-case) and the name of the content element separated by -. The following type definition is used as an example in the following explanations. It uses one content element: @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = \"rendition\") public interface MyDocument { } A matching profile for the content element named rendition of the interface MyDocument would be selected using the following steps: Check if there is a profile called my_document-rendition. If so, use it. If not, check if there is a profile called my_document. If so, use it. If not, check if there is a default storage profile. If so, use it. If none of the steps above succeeded, an exception is thrown. The following example shows the simplest possible configuration. The type definition does not contain any content element. It implicitly uses the default content element named content. The content element will be stored in a storage profile called my_document, or, if no such profile exists, in the default storage profile. @Type(ContentType.DOCUMENT) public interface MyDocument { } The next example shows the same type definition, but with an annotation that defines which storage profile to use. @Type(ContentType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = ContentElement.CONTENT, profile=\"fileSystemProfile\") public interface MyDocument { } The next example shows a type definition that contains two content elements. The \"rendition\" content element will support only PDF documents. The PDFs contained in the rendition content element will be stored in an S3 storage. The content in the other element will either be stored in a profile called my_document-content, in a profile called my_document or, if neither of those profiles exists, in the default profile. @Type(ContentType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name=\"content\") @ContentElement(name=\"rendition\", contentType=\"application/pdf\", storageProfile=\"s3Profile\") public interface MyDocument { } The service uses a plug-in interface for connection to the specific storage provider. The following plugins are currently available: Class name: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin. The FileSystemPlugin offers storage of the data as files in the file system. Configuration parameters of the file system parameter meaning storagePath Path to the directory that is used to store the files Class name: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.s3.S3Plugin. The S3 plug-in stores data in an Amazon S3 compatible storage. If arveo has no permissions to create buckets, then the administrator has to create the buckets manually. Configuration parameter of the S3 plugin Parameter Meaning Default value pathStyleAccessEnabled Configures the client to use path-style access for all requests.

If not set, the default configuration of the Amazon S3 SDK will be used. proxyhost The optional proxy host used by the client when connecting to the S3 storage. proxyprotocol The protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) used to connect to the proxy. proxyport The port used by the client to connect to the proxy. streambuffersize Size of the send- and receive-buffers in bytes. 32768 uploadpresignedurl If set to true, the client will use pre-signed URL requests to communicate with the S3 storage. false acceleratemode Configures the client to use S3 accelerate endpoint for all requests. false maxconnection The maximum number of allowed open HTTP connections. -1 (no limit) maxErrorRetries The maximum number of retries for failed requests. -1 (no retries) baseDelay The base delay in milliseconds for the retry policy. -1 (no delay) maxBackoffTime The maximum backoff time in milliseconds for the retry policy. -1 (no maximum backoff time) backoffStrategy The backoff strategy used by the retry policy. retentionEnabled Enables the use of S3 object locks for object retention. false retentionMode Specifies the protection level of retention object locks. Can be COMPLIANCE or GOVERNANCE. GOVERNANCE The Amazon S3 SDK used to connect to a S3 compatible storage supports different ways to retry failed requests. By default, a retry policy using jitter and 3 retries is used. To configure a custom retry policy, all three parameters baseDelay, maxBackoffTime and backoffStrategy have to be configured. The backoffStrategy parameter must be set to one of the following values: FULL_JITTER EQUAL_JITTER EXPONENTIAL The Amazon documentation contains an explanation of the different strategies. The S3 plugin supports the usage of S3 object locks to set a retention time and litigation hold status on content elements stored in the S3 compatible storage. To enable the feature, set the parameter retentionEnabled to true. When the retention support is enabled, the bucket used by the storage profile must be created manually. The S3 Object Locks option must be enabled for the bucket. The S3 plugin uses the governance retention mode by default, which means, that retention protected objects can be deleted by or overwritten by any user of the AWS account with the required privileges. When the compliance retention mode is used, no user (not even the root administrator of the S3 account) is able to delete or overwrite retention protected objects. To configure this behavior, set the property retentionMode to GOVERNANCE or COMPLIANCE. More information about object locks can be found in the AWS documentation. When the COMPLIANCE retention mode is used, it is impossible to delete objects from the S3 storage account before the end of the retention interval is reached. Class name: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.azureblob.AzureBlobStoragePlugin The Azure blob storage plugin can be used to connect to a storage account in Microsoft Azure. Configuration parameter of the azure blob storage plugin Parameter Meaning Default value connectionString The connection string used to connect to the storage account. The access string can be obtained from the azure portal. containerName The name of the container in the storage account that will contain the data of the storage profile. timeoutMillis The timeout in milliseconds for requests to Azure. 5000 retentionSupport Enables usage of the immutability policy feature of Azure. false policyMode Sets the protection level of the immutability policies. Can be LOCKED or UNLOCKED. UNLOCKED Additional parameters contained in the plugin configuration will be passed on to the Configuration used for the Azure SDK. The Azure blob storage plugin supports the immutability policy feature of Azure blob storage. Using this feature enables an additional security level for retention protected content elements. If a content element is retention protected or in a litigation hold, it will not be possible to delete it using the Azure management interface or the Azure SDK. To enable the retention support, the parameter retentionSupport must be set to true. When the retention support is enabled, the container used by the storage profile must be created manually in Azure. The setting version-level immutability support must be enabled when the container is created. To be able to enable the version-level immutability support, the storage account must support versioning for blobs. More information can be found in the Azure documentation. The plugin creates unlocked immutability policies by default. Unlocked policies can be altered by Azure users with the required privileges. Locked immutability policies can neither be deleted nor can the expiry time be shortened. Prolonging the expiry time (and by this, the retention period), is still possible. Note that even the administrator of the storage account is not able to delete objects with a locked immutability policy. To configure the policy mode, set the parameter policyMode to LOCKED or UNLOCKED. When the policyMode is set to LOCKED, it is not possible to delete retention protected objects from the storage account before the end of the retention interval is reached. Class name: de.eitco.ecr.server.storage.plugins.BucketOrganizerPlugin. The BucketOrganizer is not specific for a specific storage technology or storage interface but delegates storage requests to other storage plugins.The selection of the target plugin depends on the retention information of the document that contains the content element to be stored. The selection criteria that are used to select the target plugin can be configured in terms of a list of bucket selection rules. The relevant retention information of the document is defined by the values of the system fields RETENTION_DATE and LITIGATION_HOLD. This value pair is matched against the bucket selection rules.The matching process starts with the first rule and continues to the next rule if the rule does not match the value pair.The matching process ends at the first rule that matches the value pair.The storage profile named in this rule will be used to store the content. Each bucket selection rule consists of three parts that are separated by the pipe (|) symbol. The retention date match expression is usually a time interval that begins at some calendar day and extends to some later calendar day. The notation for the interval is inspired by ISO 8601 and may read like this 2021-01-01+01:00—​2022-01-01+01:00. The general format is begin_date—​end_date, that is both dates are separated by \"--\". A retention date matches the expression if begin date ⇐ retention date < end date. The begin and end dates are specified as YYYY-MM-DD followed by a time zone offset as +hh:mm or -hh:mm It is possible to define open intervals by specifying one of the boundary dates as UNBOUNDED. Retention dates may be NULL if the retention date has not (yet) been set on the document. A NULL retention date will not match any interval specified in a match rule. For this reason the retention date match expression may be specified to be NULL to match NULL retention dates. A retention date match expression can also be specified to be * if the rule should always match. The litigation hold match expression can be one of these literals: true, false, *. While the literal * will always match, the other literals will match the denoted value only. The name of the target storage profile to be used if both expressions match the corresponding system field values Configuration parameters of BucketOrganizer plugin Parameter Meaning bucketSelectionRules A list of bucket selection rules Example storage: profiles: bucketProfile: (1) pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.server.storage.plugins.BucketOrganizerPlugin (2) pluginSettings: bucketSelectionRules: (3) - \"*|true|fsProfileLitigationHold\" (4) (5) - \"NULL|false|fsProfileForever\" (4) - \"2021-01-01+01:00--2022-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2021\" (4) - \"2022-01-01+01:00--2023-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2022\" (4) - \"2023-01-01+01:00--2024-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2023\" (4) - \"2024-01-01+01:00--2025-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2024\" (4) - \"2025-01-01+01:00--2026-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2025\" (4) - \"2026-01-01+01:00--2027-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2026\" (4) - \"2027-01-01+01:00--2028-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2027\" (4) - \"2028-01-01+01:00--2029-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2028\" (4) - \"2029-01-01+01:00--2030-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2029\" (4) - \"2030-01-01+01:00--2031-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile2030\" (4) - \"*|*|fsProfileAnotherEra\" (4) fsProfileLitigationHold: (5) pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin pluginSettings: storagePath: ${project.build.directory}/storage/litigationHold fsProfileForever: pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin pluginSettings: storagePath: ${project.build.directory}/storage/forever fsProfile2021: pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin pluginSettings: storagePath: ${project.build.directory}/storage/2021 #... fsProfile2030: pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin pluginSettings: storagePath: ${project.build.directory}/storage/2030 fsProfileAnotherEra: pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin pluginSettings: storagePath: ${project.build.directory}/storage/anotherEra 1 profile name; 2 type of plugin, so its class name; 3 rules list. 4 a bucket selection rule, consisting of retention date match expression, litigation hold match expression and target storage profile name. 5 the referenced profile name. To reduce the number of required entries in the list of bucket selection rules, storage profile templates can be used. A storage profile template consists of a name template with placeholders, a specific time range and the regular configuration parameters like the class name of the storage profile.The <year> placeholder can be used as a variable for the current year. Storage profile templates are configured in a separate section as shown below: Storage profile template configuration ecr: server: storage: profiles: bucketProfile: pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.server.storage.plugins.BucketOrganizerPlugin pluginSettings: bucketSelectionRules: - \"*|true|fsProfileLitigationHold\" - \"NULL|false|fsProfileForever\" - \"<year>-01-01+01:00|false|fsProfile<year>|2021--2030\" (1) profile-templates: - nameTemplate: \"fsProfile<year>\" (2) genericTimeRange: \"2021--2029\" (3) pluginClassName: de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin pluginSettings: storagePath: ${storage.base.directory}/storage/<year> (4) 1 A bucket selection rule using a profile template with the year placeholder for the years between 2021 and 2030. 2 A name template that will create profiles for the years 2021 to 2029. 3 Defines the time range used to create profiles based on the template 4 The year placeholder can be used in the configuration properties of the plugin. As mentioned above, arveo uses a plugin interface for the connection to the storage backends. This section describes how to write a new storage plugin. All classes and interfaces required to implement a custom plugin are contained in the dependency <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-server</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> <scope>provided</scope> </dependency> A storage plugin must implement the interface de.eitco.ecr.server.storage.StoragePlugin. There are two abstract implementations that can be extended to simplify the implementation: AbstractStoragePlugin: Provides several methods that make it easier to get plugin configuration settings. AbstractSimplifiedStoragePlugin: The superclass of all plugins that do not need retention support In addition to the interface to implement, there are some guidelines to respect when writing a custom storage plugin: The plugin must provide a default no argument constructor because it will be instantiated using reflection. The plugin can use dependency injection, but because of the need for a default constructor, only field injection using @Autowired is possible. There will be one instance of the plugin for each storage profile configured to use the plugin, so the plugin must be thread-safe. The StoragePlugin interface contains a method called configure, which will be called once for each plugin instance. It is used to process the generic parameter values that might be required to configure the plugin. For example, the parameters might contain a path to a file system directory or credentials for a remote storage system. Because storage plugins can be configured in profile templates, it might be necessary to replace placeholders configured in the template. The class AbstractStoragePlugin already contains helper methods like getMandatoryProperty that take care of these replacements. The configure method is expected to return the actual configuration with all replacements that is used by this plugin instance. The returned configuration settings are used by the health checks. To use the custom plugin, it is enough to add its classes to the classpath of the repository service. The plugin can then be used for a storage profile by specifying it’s qualified class name in the pluginClassName parameter. To add the plugin’s class to the classpath, use the -Dloader.path=<path> argument to start the service. The argument must point to a directory containing the required jar files.","title":"Configure Storage Locations","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"content-elements-storage","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/content-elements-storage.html","titles":[{"text":"Content and type definitions","hash":"content_and_type_definitions","id":1},{"text":"Types of content elements","hash":"_types_of_content_elements","id":2},{"text":"The default content element","hash":"the_default_content_element","id":3},{"text":"The ContentElement annotation","hash":"the_contentelement_annotation","id":4},{"text":"Storage profiles","hash":"storage_profiles","id":5},{"text":"Using aliases for storage profiles","hash":"using_aliases_for_storage_profiles","id":6},{"text":"Mapping content elements to storage profiles","hash":"_mapping_content_elements_to_storage_profiles","id":7},{"text":"Mapping by code","hash":"mapping_by_code","id":8},{"text":"Mapping by configuration","hash":"mapping_by_configuration","id":9},{"text":"Examples","hash":"examples","id":10},{"text":"Plugin configuration","hash":"plugin_configuration","id":11},{"text":"File system","hash":"_file_system","id":12},{"text":"AWS, NetAPP or EMC Elastic Cloud Storage","hash":"aws_netapp_or_emc_elastic_cloud_storage","id":13},{"text":"Configuring the retry policy of the S3 plugin","hash":"configuring_the_retry_policy_of_the_s3_plugin","id":14},{"text":"Retention","hash":"retention","id":15},{"text":"Azure blob storage","hash":"azure_blob_storage","id":16},{"text":"Retention","hash":"retention_2","id":17},{"text":"BucketOrganizer","hash":"_bucketorganizer","id":18},{"text":"1.  retention date match expression","hash":"1_retention_date_match_expression","id":19},{"text":"2.  litigation hold match expression","hash":"2_litigation_hold_match_expression","id":20},{"text":"3.  target storage profile name","hash":"3_target_storage_profile_name","id":21},{"text":"Configuration parameters","hash":"configuration_parameters","id":22},{"text":"Storage profile templates","hash":"_storage_profile_templates","id":23},{"text":"Writing a custom storage plugin","hash":"writing_a_custom_storage_plugin","id":24},{"text":"Configuration settings","hash":"configuration_settings","id":25},{"text":"Using the custom storage plugin","hash":"using_the_custom_storage_plugin","id":26}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"arveo uses the default spring datasource configuration for the JDBC datasource.

Refer to the troubleshooting section if this is not the case. In this shell you can enter commands and queries. Let’s start with a simple but very important command: help. This command displays all commands available and is able to give more detailed information about them. When entering the command help the shell should display information like this: ecr:>help AVAILABLE COMMANDS Authentication Command logout: discards authentication to ecr system login: authenticates to ecr system Built-In Commands help: Display help about available commands stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error. clear: Clear the shell screen. quit, exit: Exit the shell. history: Display or save the history of previously run commands version: Show version info script: Read and execute commands from a file. Deletion Command purge: Purges all entities of a given type that meet a constraint.

Since arveo shell is built using spring shell, the build-in commands are documented in the spring shell documentation. Those commands focus on the shell functionality itself. Let us focus on arveo specific functionality instead. In order to do anything in an arveo system you need to be authenticated. To do this, use the login command: To authenticate use the login command: ecr:>help login NAME login - authenticates to ecr system SYNOPSIS login [--username String] [--password String] --help OPTIONS --username String [Mandatory] --password String [Mandatory] --help or -h help for login [Optional] Typing login --username [user-name] --password [password] will log you on the arveo system. It will print a message like: ecr:>login --username [user] --password [password] logged in as [user] with user id [numeric-user-id] So far the shell was able to contact the arveo system and authenticate you. Let us execute a simple query: In an arveo system there are several type registered. They define the customized scenario and are the core element of an arveo system. For more on types refer to the arveo developer documentation. We can get the names of the types registered by typing ecr:>types This will list all available types in the system, for example: ecr:>types medical_record_patient_scenario_metadata folder_with_default_retention invoice child_entity named_meta_named_entity customer ecr:> Since arveo shell uses spring to be configured, you have several possibilities to configure properties of the shell. You can specify properties as java system properties: java -Dmy.property=myValue -jar ecr-shell-{arveo-version}.jar -Dmy.property=myValue must be placed before -jar Properties may be specified as program arguments: java -jar ecr-shell-{arveo-version}.jar --my.property=myValue --my.property=myValue must be placed after -jar ecr-shell-22.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar Additionally, properties can be written to a property or yaml file named application.properties or application.yaml respectively: application.yaml my: property: myValue arveo shell does use spring cloud config, so it may also be configured using the eitco config service. Its spring.application.name is ecr-shell so you can add the file above renamed to ecr-shell.yaml to your config service. arveo shell will automatically get the config servers url using the eitco service registry. The import command scans a folder recursively for import descriptions and creates new arveo entities depending on this description. By default, the current folder is scanned and only .json files are read. This behaviour can be changed using the command line parameters directory, include and exclude. The import description is written in json - it is an object with one property imports which is a list: { \"imports\" : [] } Every element of the list specifies one arveo entity. Thus it is mandatory that every description specifies its type name: { \"imports\" : [ { \"type\": \"<type-name>\" } ] } Attribute values can be specified using the properties element: { \"imports\" : [ { \"type\": \"<type-name>\", \"properties\": { \"stringProperty\": \"string value\", \"intProperty\": 8, \"booleanProperty\": true } } ] } Those properties need to be defined by the given type. Additionally, the values given must adhere to the type of the attribute as specified by the type. Depending on the type the value must be specified as follows: data type json type string string binary base64 string boolean boolean uuid string containing uuid format date string in iso date format decimal number or string containing numerical time string containing iso time format real number datetime string containing iso zoned date time format id string string integer number array json list containing elements adhering to the elements type In arveo entities can be documents. This means that they have binary content attached. Content elements in arveo have a name defined by the type of the entity. Content can be given two ways: First using the property contentMap: { \"imports\": [ { \"type\": \"document_with_rendition\", \"properties\": { \"name\": \"shell-import\", \"content_type\": \"text/plain\" }, \"contentMap\": { \"original\": \"file:../content/content.txt\" } } ] } In this case the content element with the name original is assigned the binary content given by the file ../content/content.txt. The file name is resolved relative to the file containing the reference NOT the working directory of the shell. Alternatively, the url could also be an http(s) or data url. Should the type only contain one content element, the element could also be given using the content property: { \"imports\": [ { \"type\": \"document_with_one_content_element\", \"properties\": { \"name\": \"shell-import\", \"content_type\": \"text/plain\" }, \"content\": \"file:../content/content.txt\" } ] } In this case the name of the content element is specified since only one content element exists. Sometimes it is required to create a new entity - but only if it does not exist yet. Should it exist it should only be updated. In such a situation a unique attribute is required to identify the entity. If such an attribute exists it can be specified using the collisionCheckAttribute property: { \"imports\": [ { \"type\": \"named_file\", \"symbolicName\": \"the_file\", \"properties\": { \"mime_type\": \"application/octet-stream\", \"name\": \"the_file\" }, \"contentMap\": { \"ce1\": \"data:text/plain;charset=UTF-8,this_is_data\", \"content\": \"data:text/plain;charset=US-ASCII,this_is_data\" }, \"collisionCheckAttribute\": \"name\", \"variables\": { \"link\": \"false\" } }, { \"type\": \"file_link\", \"properties\": { \"mime_type\": \"application/octet-stream\", \"name\": \"the_link\", \"target\": \"the_file\" }, \"collisionCheckAttribute\": \"name\" } ] } Note that the property collisionCheckAttribute is set to name in line 14. Note further that in line 8 it is set to \"the_file\". The attribute name is unique, so if this import is executed and an entity whose attribute name is set to \"the_file\" already exists, no new entity is created, but the entity is updated with the given properties and content instead. In some cases it is required to import several entities that relate to each other using foreign keys. In this case it is possible to refer to the id of other imported entities in integer attributes using the symbolicName property: { \"imports\": [ { \"type\": \"named_file\", \"symbolicName\": \"the_file\", \"properties\": { \"mime_type\": \"application/octet-stream\", \"name\": \"the_file\" }, \"contentMap\": { \"ce1\": \"data:text/plain;charset=UTF-8,this_is_data\", \"content\": \"data:text/plain;charset=US-ASCII,this_is_data\" }, \"collisionCheckAttribute\": \"name\", \"variables\": { \"link\": \"false\" } }, { \"type\": \"file_link\", \"properties\": { \"mime_type\": \"application/octet-stream\", \"name\": \"the_link\", \"target\": \"the_file\" }, \"collisionCheckAttribute\": \"name\" } ] } Note that the first entity is named \"the_file\" using the property symbolicName in line 5. Note further that in line 24 the integer attribute target is assigned a string that is the symbolic name of the entity. The import command will create both entities in one batch setting the target attribute of the second entity to the id of the first entity. The import command will order the entities in a way so that referenced entities will be stored first. In this example it will not change the order of the entities. If the login command fails with the following error message: ecr:>login ecr-user password Did not find a client registration for the required grant type password Details of the error have been omitted. You can use the stacktrace command to print the full stacktrace. ecr:> the shell has no configuration for authentication. This could mean two things: Either the arveo system is not running or not reachable and thus the configuration (provided by the config service) is not accessible, or the configuration is missing. In the first case check whether the arveo system is up and running and reachable. By default, the shell assumes the service registry to be available at the well known location (http://localhost:8761). If this is not the case in your environment, this can be overridden with the property eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone. java \"-Deureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=<url-of-service-registry>\" -jar ecr-shell-{arveo-version}.jar In the second case you need to configure an oauth2 client registry, since the shell can only execute commands and queries to a running arveo system to which it should authenticate. In order to do so add the following to your shell’s configuration: spring: security: oauth2: client: registration: keycloak-password: provider: keycloak client-id: <your client id> client-secret: <your client secret> authorization-grant-type: \"password\" scope: \"openid\" This config is adapted to the most common scenario where keycloak is used as authentication service. You will need to get the correct client-id and client-secret from the arveo system configuration. In the most convenient way this is already configured in the eitco config service.","title":"arveo shell","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"ecr-shell","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/ecr-shell.html","titles":[{"text":"Executing Commands","hash":"executing_commands","id":1},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"authentication","id":2},{"text":"Types","hash":"types","id":3},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"configuration","id":4},{"text":"Import","hash":"import","id":5},{"text":"Import description format","hash":"import_description_format","id":6},{"text":"Documents with content","hash":"documents_with_content","id":7},{"text":"Upsert","hash":"upsert","id":8},{"text":"Related entities","hash":"related_entities","id":9},{"text":"Troubleshooting","hash":"troubleshooting","id":10},{"text":"arveo system not reachable / no authentication configured","hash":"_arveo-unreachable","id":11}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"arveo provides a transparent encryption for data stored in the profiles. The encryption can be configured individually for each storage profile. Encrypting and decrypting is performed by configurable encryption providers. Each provider is identified by a unique name. The available providers are described below. The following tables give an overview of encryption settings for a storage profile. Encryption settings Parameter Description Default value enabled enables or disables the encryption false providerName name of the encryption provider to use commons-aes To make sure all content of a specific type definition is encrypted, make sure to limit the content types supported by the type definition to types that use an encrypting storage profile. When the BucketOrganizerPlugin is used, the encryption settings must be configured for each plugin referenced by the bucket selection rules. Configuring the encryption for the BucketOrganizerPlugin itself is not supported. The commons-aes provider supports AES encryption with 256bit keys. When a new content element is created in an encrypted profile, the provider generates a random cipher key for the element. The key is encrypted using a master password that is configured in the profile’s encryption settings. It is then stored in the database, which creates an identifier for the key. The keys are stored in individual tables for each profile called ecr_keys_<profileName>. After that, the content is encrypted and stored using the profile’s storage plugin. The key-id is stored in a header together with the encrypted data. When the data is read, the cipher key is loaded from the database using the key-id read from the header. The key is decrypted using the master password and used to decrypt the data read by the profile’s storage plugin. When the database table containing the keys or the master password is lost, it is impossible to restore the data stored in the profile. When the master password for a profile is changed, it is required to re-encrypt all stored keys for the profile. In the future, there will be a way to re-encrypt keys. For now, this issue hasn’t been implemented yet. There is a second database table for each profile called ecr_keys_assoc_<profileName>. This table contains mappings of key IDs to content element IDs and is intended for system administration purposes. The encryption feature is configured as shown in the following example: Configuration of encryption for a storage profile storage: profiles: encryptedProfile: pluginClassName: \"de.eitco.ecr.storage.plugin.filesystem.FileSystemPlugin\" pluginSettings: storagePath: \"/storage/encrypted\" encryptionSettings: enabled: true providerName: \"commons-aes\" providerSettings: password: \"changeme\" The following tables give an overview of encryption settings for the commons-aes provider: Provider specific settings for 'commons-aes' Parameter Description Default value password the master password used to encrypt the cipher keys rngAlgorithm the algorithm used to generate secure random data Platform specific. See docs for SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(). If not specified, the most secure algorithm available will be used The vault-aes encryption provider uses the transit secrets engine of Hashicorp Vault to encrypt and decrypt a generated random cipher key. The cipher key is generated using a configurable random data generation algorithm and then used to encrypt the content with AES as described below. The cipher key is then encrypted by Vault and stored in a header together with the encrypted content data. When the data is decrypted, the encrypted cipher key is read from the header, decrypted using Vault and then used to decrypt the content. The advantage in comparison to the commons-aes provider is that no master key and no stored encryption keys in the database are required. The keys required to decrypt the cipher keys (and though the data, too) are securely stored in Vault and are never known to arveo. When the Vault instance containing the keyring used to encrypt the random cipher keys is lost, it is impossible to decrypt the content data!

The encryption library is designed to encrypt data in such a way that it can be stored permanently in encrypted form and possibly only decrypted after a long time. In order to guarantee decryption, all data required for this (except the key, of course) are stored in a header together with the encrypted data. Using the data from the header, the library can thus obtain, for example, the algorithm used and the data for key derivation, and only needs the password or the derived key for decryption. The library uses AES according to the recommendation of the Federal Office for Information Security of March 2020: Operating mode: Galois/Counter-Mode Hash function for key derivation: Argon2 The library allows the configuration of different parameters, but offers default values according to the recommendation of the BSI: Key length: 256 bit Length of GCM checksums: 128 bit Length of the initialisation vector: 96 bit Length of the salt for the key derivation: 32 bit Parallelism for Argon2: 1 Memory cost for Argon2: 4096 KB Iterations for Argon2: 3 The initialisation vector is randomly generated each time the encryption methods are called by using SecureRandom. The salt for the key derivation is generated in the same way each time the password derivation method is called. The fact that the initialisation vector is always regenerated ensures that the same combination of initialisation vector and key can never be used more than once. For both the AES algorithm and the Argon2 hash function, the implementations of the BouncyCastle library are used. For performance and compatibility reasons, the BouncyCastle implementations are used directly and not via the JCA: Generation of the AES cipher with GCM GCMBlockCipher cipher = new GCMBlockCipher(new AESEngine()); Generation of the Argon2 hash generator Argon2BytesGenerator generator = new Argon2BytesGenerator(); Since the default implementation of the CipherInputStream from javax.crypto is not suitable for block ciphers with data authentication, the implementations for CipherInputStream and CipherOutputStream from the BouncyCastle library are used. To generate the random data for the initialisation vector and the salt, a SecureRandom instance created with SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong() is used by default. However, the library allows you to specify a different RNG algorithm (see Note on Linux below). The header begins with a string to identify data encrypted with the library followed by the length of the payload data in the header. The header is divided into blocks and can be read serially. ++>~ENC~<++|97|AES_GCM_ARGON2|1|256|128|10|4096|1|aWFtYW5pbml0aWFsaXphdGlvbnZlY3Rvcg==|aWFtYXNhbHQ=|bXlLZXlJZA== Marker|length|method|header version|key length|checksum length|iteration|storage cost|parallelism|initialisation vector|salt|key ID The keys used for encryption are either generated using random data or derived from any password using the Argon2 hash function. Since deriving keys can be very computationally intensive depending on the configuration, a key ID can be stored in the header. This makes it possible to store a key once it has been derived and to reuse it for decryption, which avoids having to derive the key from the password again. The library is not responsible for the secure storage of the key. Generating keys using random data is a much faster operation compared to key derivation. The disadvantage is, that it is not possible to derive the key from a master password in case it was lost. When generated keys are used, it is crucial to store those keys in a secure location. In this case, the header will not contain a salt but only the ID of the stored key. When an external system like Vault is used to encrypt generated keys, the encrypted generated key is stored in the header instead. Instantiation of the AesEncryptorAndDecryptor: Instantiation with default parameters AesEncryptorAndDecryptor encryptorAndDecryptor=new AesEncryptorAndDecryptor.Builder().build(); Instantiation with customised parameters AesEncryptorAndDecryptor encryptorAndDecryptor=new AesEncryptorAndDecryptor.Builder() .with128BitKeys() .withInitializationVectorLength(128) .withTagLength(128) .withIterations(5) .withMemoryCost(1024) .withParallelism(3) .withSaltLength(64) .withRngAlgorithm(\"SHA1PRNG\") .build(); Examples of usage can be found in the test class de.eitco.commons.crypto.AesEncryptionTest. On Linux, Java uses the NativePRNG algorithm by default for generating random data with SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong(). This implementation uses /dev/random and may block if there is not enough data available there. This can lead to very long waiting times for key derivation and encryption. You can then either use a weaker RNG algorithm or make sure that /dev/random always contains enough data. This can be achieved with the haveged daemon, for example: apt-get install haveged update-rc.d haveged defaults service haveged start","title":"Configure Encryption","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"encryption","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/encryption.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Commons AES provider","hash":"commons_aes_provider","id":2},{"text":"Vault AES provider","hash":"vault_aes_provider","id":3},{"text":"Implementation details of AES encryption","hash":"implementation_details_of_aes_encryption","id":4},{"text":"Header","hash":"header","id":5},{"text":"AES","hash":"aes","id":6},{"text":"Header Format","hash":"header_format","id":7},{"text":"Key","hash":"key","id":8},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":9},{"text":"Note on Linux","hash":"note_on_linux","id":10}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"These instructions describe the installation procedure, the installation content and the items required for commissioning the product. We recommend controlling the rollout of the arveo services by a continuous integration process that provides all artefact required for the deployment of the required content services and your web solution and integrations. Depending on the underlying platform, deployment takes place via binary service artifacts that are deployed on pre-installed VMs or via containerized applications that are made available in the host cloud system. This chapter describes the compliant On Premise installation provided by Eitco. The configuration and deployment of all required artefacts is performed by Eitco or a partner by the automated deployment tool \"Puppet\". The customer provides several virtual machines that are configured by Eitco with the automated deployment tool Puppet (Puppet Deployment) in order to ensure a problem-free software rollout in the customer system. Depending on the service level agreement Eitco can guarantee high availability, reliability and high performance at all times. The system has to be protected from manipulation attempts by technical or organizational measures. The data that is stored and managed in the system is protected via the API. The access and editing rights are managed with an attribute based access control (ABAC). More detailed information on this is provided in the relevant chapters of this manual. All changes to the system and the data are logged via the API, and the changes are traceable via the audit log. If auditing is activated, every database change is logged. In order to guarantee the atomicity of the transactions and to avoid inconsistent states, all are aborted transactions removed and rolled back. Access to all data (documents, metadata) is exclusively provided via the API, with the corresponding protection mechanisms so that the security of the data is guaranteed at all times. Puppet is open source software developed by Puppet Labs and is used for the automated configuration and deployment of software deliveries. It ensures the configuration management of servers with both Unix-like operating systems and the Windows operating system via network. The Ad-min-Tool allows the automated configuration of computers and servers as well as the services installed on them. The arveo services are installed and configured with Puppet. After the server has been provided, see System Requirements, the Puppet Agent is installed on it, which then takes care of setting up the environment and the actual application. The duration of the installation process can vary and requires an adequate internet connection. The individual installation components are installed in the form of .deb packages. The installation is completely automated and carried out remotely. 3rd Party Services PostgreSQL 17.0 Database 21 Keycloak Authentication Service Active MQ 6.1.5 Message Service Hub arveo Content Services Document Service Registry Service Configuration Service Audit Service (optional) Document Conversion Service (optional) Enterprise Integration Service (optional) Customer Applications & Services Eitco or Customer application and integration services (typically web client and Apache Camel integration end pints) Following you find the order of the service starts.

The following special feature must be observed: the X509 extension “Subject Alternative Name” must contain all DNS names and IP addresses via which the respective systems are accessed. Each arveo system has a unique identifier that is part of each entity- and version-id. This concept makes it possible to merge two systems into one.

These jobs are managed by a clustered Quartz scheduler running inside the repository service and/or in a dedicated job service. The scheduler instances are synchronized using the database. The repository service creates the jobs and initial trigger configurations when the system is started for the first time. Afterwards, it is possible to modify the scheduled jobs manually. By default, the scheduler embedded in the repository service is used to create and to execute the jobs. Dedicated job service instances configured to use the same database as the repository service can be used to execute the jobs as well. It is also possible to start the scheduler embedded in the repository service in standby mode. In standby mode, the repository service will create the jobs (if required), but it will not execute them. Each job can be enabled or disabled individually. No triggers will be created for disabled jobs. A disabled job will not execute even if a trigger for the job has already been created. The available configuration parameters for the scheduler are listed here: Job service The available configuration parameters for the jobs are listed here: Job configuration It is possible to use one or more external Job Service instances to execute the scheduled system jobs. To be able to execute the system jobs, the job implementations must be present in each of the Job Service’s class paths. The jobs are available as a ZIP file (ecr-packaging-jobs-external-22.0.4-SNAPSHOT.zip) that contains all required libraries. Simply extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory (e.g. libs) and start the Job Service with the following parameter: -Dloader.path=libs. The jobs running in the external Job Service have to use the same system ID as the Content Repository Service to receive messages from the correct queues. Use the property ecr.system.system-id (default=1) to set the correct ID in the configuration file for the Job Service. The triggers for the system jobs running in the external job scheduler will be created automatically. For this to work, the job services requires a running instance of the Content Repository Service to get information about the available type definitions. The configuration parameters for the jobs are already configured in the database. No further configuration parameters for the jobs are required in the Job Service’s configuration. However, the service must be able to authenticate to the repository service. When the jobs use a username and password to obtain an access token, the service needs OAuth client registrations both for the client_credentials and for the password grant types. The following example shows how to configure two client registrations for the service: OAuth client registrations spring: security: oauth2: resourceserver: jwt: issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:39004\" client: registration: autorization-service-client-credentials: provider: authorization-service client-id: \"changeit\" client-secret: \"changeit\" authorization-grant-type: \"client_credentials\" authorization-service-password: provider: authorization-service client-id: \"changeit\" client-secret: \"changeit\" authorization-grant-type: \"password\" provider: authorization-service: issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:39004\" The username and password to use for the jobs can be configured using the following parameters in the configuration file for the Job Service. If those parameters are not configured, the jobs will use a technical authentication using a client-credentials grant. In this case, only one client registration using the client_credentials grant type is required. Job user authentication ecr: server: jobs: username: \"username\" password: \"password\" Enabling or disabling a job in either the Content Repository Service or the external Job Service decides where a job will run. The following example shows how to disable certain system jobs. The same configuration can be used for the Content Repository Service and the Job Service. disabling jobs ecr: server: jobs: retry-renditions: enabled: false retry-full-text-extraction: enabled: false arveo provides a system job that can be used to scan a storage profile for content elements that are no longer referenced by an entity in the database. This job is intended to be triggered manually to perform cleanup operations after system failures. The job writes the IDs of identified abandoned content elements to a file. The content elements will not be deleted from the storage. Depending on the number of content elements in the storage and the number of entities in the database, the job might take a long time to run. The job requires two parameters: profile: The name of the storage profile to scan fileName: A path to a file that will contain the IDs of identified abandonded content elements. The storage profile must be a \"real\" profile. The bucket organizer plugin, wich distributes content over several actual profiles, does not support listing all content IDs and cannot be used for the job. The ecr-shell can be used to trigger the job. The following example shows how to run the job with the two parameters mentioned above: trigger ecr-find-abandoned-content \"{\\\"profile\\\":\\\"fsProfileHeap\\\",\\\"fileName\\\":\\\"c:/contentids.csv\\\"}\" The file written by the find abandoned content elements job can be used as an input for the delete abandoned content elements job to actually delete the content from the storage. This job, too, is not triggered automatically but must be triggered manually. The ecr-shell can be used to trigger the job as shown below: trigger ecr-delete-abandoned-content \"{\\\"profile\\\":\\\"fsProfileHeap\\\",\\\"fileName\\\":\\\"c:/contentids.csv\\\"}\" The job will delete the blobs in batches.

If the database schema change fails, the instance terminates in a way that can be easily evaluated by the administrator to be able to react to this exception. The service does not start if registry query returns other running instances. The service terminates after the liquibase script is executed. The following two parameters are set: system: terminateAfterCreation: true updateSchema: true So the maintenance mode can be used to update the database schema. When the maintenance mode is enabled, the arveo starts, performs necessary schema updates, and terminates once the schema was updated. Requests from clients are not processed while the system is in maintenance mode. Clients will receive a HTTP 503 response code. Schema updates must be performed by one single arveo instance to avoid race conditions. The recommended procedure for a schema update is as follows: Shut down all arveo instances If required: Update to a newer arveo version Enable maintenance mode by setting system.maintenanceMode: true in the configuration Start one single arveo instance and wait for it to shut down after the schema was updated Disable maintenance mode in the configuration Start all arveo instances. The database schema of an existing system can be changed by adapting the type definition classes and restarting the repository service with the setting arveo.server.system.maintenance-mode=true. The service will update the database schema and shut down once the update is finished. It will not accept requests while the schema is updated. The following list contains the supported schema changes. Note that some changes like removing an attribute or adding constraints might not be possible when the existing data or existing constraints might be violated by the change. Adding a new attribute. Removing an existing attribute. Note that the column will be dropped from the schema. Adding and removing indexes as well as changing index properties. Change the primary key (only for META types). Adding and removing of foreign keys. Add new content elements (only for DOCUMENT types). Adding and removing unique constraints. Adding and removing not-null constraints. It is also possible to enable certain features on existing type definitions. Disabling the features is not supported. Enabling document filing. Enabling optimistic locking. Enabling the recycle bin. Enabling retention support. By setting the properties arveo.server.system.maintenanceMode and arveo.server.system.logSchemaChanges to true, the system will start up, check for required schema changes, write them to a special log file, and shut down again. The database schema will not be changed. This makes it possible to check for unsupported changes to the schema before performing the actual schema update. The directory used to store the schema update log can be specified using the property arveo.server.system.schemaChangeLogDirectory. The default value is logs. The contents of the file will look like the following example: Supported changes for attributes of type definition my_document: - document_name: IS_UNIQUE - container_id: FOREIGN_KEY, IS_UNIQUE Unsupported changes for attributes of type definition my_document: - document_name: none - container_id: none In this example, there are three supported changes for the type definition named my_document. A unique constraint will be added to or removed from the attributes container_id and document_name and a foreign key will be added to or removed from the attribute container_id. There are no unsupported changes, so the actual schema update should succeed. Please note that there are some advanced schema checks that can only be done correctly when the types are actually stored in the database. For example, the checks for the correctness of parent- and child- types of a relation type is not possible when the schema update itself is skipped.","title":"Maintenance mode for the database schema","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"maintenance-mode-db-schema","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/maintenance-mode-db-schema.html","titles":[{"text":"Supported schema changes","hash":"supported_schema_changes","id":1},{"text":"Checking for schema changes","hash":"checking_for_schema_changes","id":2}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"arveo uses Apache ActiveMQ to queue asynchronous tasks.

The overview of all actuator endpoints is available at /actuator. Health information is available at /actuator/health. In addition to the default health indicators, arveo provides the following additional health indicators: storagePlugins: Checks if at least one storage profile is configured and if all storage plugins configured in the storage profiles are able to store data. FileSystemPlugin: Checks if the configured storage directory exists and whether the database sequence used to generate storage IDs is available. S3Plugin: Checks if the configured bucket exists. When the last storage operation has failed, the endpoint checks if the S3 service is available. SwiftV2Plugin, SwiftV3Plugin: Checks if the configured container exists.

Unlike other system jobs, this job always runs within the repository service. It cannot be offloaded to a separate job service instance. The following metrics will be available once the job was activated: Metric Description ecr.jms.queue.size The number of messages currently contained in the queue. ecr.jms.queue.enqueuecount The total number of messages that have been enqueued in the queue. ecr.jms.queue.dequeuecount The total number of messages that have been dequeued from the queue. ecr.jms.queue.averageenqueuetime The average time a message was enqueued before it was dequeued. Each metric contains a tag called queue containing the name of the queue. The following queues are currently used by the repository service: Queue Description ecr-queue-content-to-purge Contains messages containing IDs of content elements that have to be purged from the storage. ecr-queue-delete-recycled Contains messages with a delivery delay that will cause an entity to be deleted from the recycle bin once it’s recycle delay has expired. ecr-queue-create-renditions Contains messages of renditions that have to be created for new content elements. DLQ.ecr-queue-create-renditions The dead letter queue for the ecr-queue-create-renditions queue.

Each of these metrics has a tag called type-definition containing the name of the type definition the measurement was taken for. arveo provides an actuator endpoint that can be used to collect metrics data using Prometheus. Prometheus collects data by periodically calling configured sources (\"scrapes\"). The following example shows an entry in the prometheus.yml file for a scrape configuration that collects data from the prometheus actuator endpoint every 15 seconds: global: scrape_interval: 15s evaluation_interval: 15s scrape_configs: - job_name: 'arveo' metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:39001'] The metrics support of arveo is based on Micrometer. To support monitoring systems like Prometheus, micrometer remembers the last maximum value of time based metrics for a configurable amount of time. This time should be close to the scrape interval of Prometheus and can be configured in the configuration properties of arveo as shown in the example below: management: metrics: export: prometheus: step: 15s The data collected by Prometheus can be visualized using Grafana. Support for other monitoring system then Prometheus can be enabled by adding the required library to the classpath. The Spring Boot documentation contains a list of the supported monitoring systems and further information about how to configure them. arveo adds the following additional attributes to the mapped diagnostic context (MDC) of the logging framework to make it easier to analyze the system’s behavior: ecr.user-id: The ID of the user performing the current request, if available ecr.trace-id: The ID of the current trace, if available. The trace-id is set by Open Telemetry (see below). ecr.span-id: The ID of the current span, if available. The span-id is set by Open Telemetry (see below). These attributes are added using a HandlerInterceptor for the REST endpoints using Spring WebMVC. Note that these attributes will not be added when arveo is used embedded. In this case, the application using the embedded arveo instance is responsible for adding required information to the MDC. Depending on the logger appender in use, it is possible to add these attributes to log messages. See the documentation of logback for details. arveo supports using Open Telemetry to monitor the system’s behavior. Most notably it is possible to view traces of requests across the different services using a tracing backend like Jaeger or Zipkin as well as metrics and logs. The outermost span of a trace that was started by a user’s request will contain the ecr.user-id attribute containing the user’s ID. This is done by the same mechanism as described above for the MDC. Because arveo is based on several widely used open source libraries, the automatic instrumentation mode of Open Telemetry can be used to record traces. This is done by the Open Telemetry java agent as described in the Open Telemetry documentation. With Open Telemetry it is possible to collect logs, metrics and traces of each arveo service. It is recommended to use an Open Telemetry Collector on the same server, VM or Kubernetes node as the service to avoid network performance issues. The Collector is able to forward the collected data to suitable observability backends like Prometheus (metrics), Loki (logs) or Jaeger (traces). Open Telemetry uses the OTLP protocol to send data to the Collector. The following example shows the required parameters to use Open Telemetry for the repository service assuming a Collector instance is running on the same machine: Start parameters for Open Telemetry -Dotel.logs.exporter=otlp -Dotel.metrics.exporter=otlp -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp -Dotel.service.name=repository-service -javaagent:<path>/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar The following diagram shows the basic setup: Figure 1. Open Telemetry Collector The required configuration properties for the Collector to forward collected data to observability backends is described in detail in the Open Telemetry documentation.","title":"Monitoring","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"monitoring","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/monitoring.html","titles":[{"text":"Custom health indicators","hash":"custom_health_indicators","id":1},{"text":"Custom endpoints","hash":"custom_endpoints","id":2},{"text":"Custom metrics","hash":"custom_metrics","id":3},{"text":"Storage","hash":"storage","id":4},{"text":"Relational database","hash":"relational_database","id":5},{"text":"JMS queues","hash":"jms_queues","id":6},{"text":"Type definitions","hash":"type_definitions","id":7},{"text":"Prometheus","hash":"prometheus","id":8},{"text":"Other monitoring systems","hash":"other_monitoring_systems","id":9},{"text":"Attributes in MDC","hash":"_attributes_in_mdc","id":10},{"text":"Open Telemetry","hash":"open_telemetry","id":11}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Renditions of content elements, for example a PDF rendition of an image, can be created automatically. To create a rendition, the @Rendition annotation can be used as shown in the following example. A document type definition with a rendition @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = \"original\", separateField = true) (1) @Rendition(name = \"rendition\", sourceElement = \"original\", contentType = MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF_VALUE, separateField = true) (2) @OverwriteAllowed public interface DocumentWithRendition { String getName(); void setName(String name); @ContentType(contentElement = \"original\") (3) String getContentType(); void setContentType(String contentType); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.RENDITION_STATUS) (4) Map<String, RenditionStatusInformation> getRenditionStatus(); } 1 The content element containing the original content 2 The rendition content element to create automatically 3 The content type of the original content 4 A getter for the current status of the renditions of the document The above example shows a document type with one content element and one rendition. Both the original and the rendition element are stored in separate fields. This is possible but not required for renditions. When the original content is stored in a separate field, meta information like the content type is not stored in the database. As the content type of the original content is required to create a rendition, it is recommended to define an attribute of type 'String' that contains the original content’s type. The attribute must be annotated with @ContentType to bind its value to the original content element and return a valid mime type string like \"image/jpeg\". If no such attribute is present, the system will try to detect the content type automatically. The current status of the renditions can be retrieved as shown in the example above. The returned map contains a RenditionStatusInformation instance for each rendition content element of the document. The status information contains a status value and the number of times the system tried to create the rendition, if available. The status of a rendition can be one of the following values: Rendition status values parameter meaning AVAILABLE The rendition was created successfully (or was uploaded by a client) and is available. PENDING The rendition is not yet available but is expected to be available in the future. FAILED Creating the rendition has failed permanently. EMPTY The rendition is not available because the source content element does not exist. RESET Creating the rendition has failed and the status was manually reset (see error handling). The @Rendition annotation accepts the following parameters: Parameters of @Rendition parameter meaning name The name of the rendition content element sourceElement The name of the content element to create a rendition of contentType The type of the rendition to create (a mime type string like \"application/pdf\") profile The name of the profile used to store the rendition content element (optional) separateField (optional) whether to store the renditions’s meta data in a separate field or in the JSON content field Renditions are created asynchronously. When a document is created or updated, a message will be posted to a queue in ActiveMQ. The messages are processed by event listeners in the repository service. Depending on the current load it might take some time until the rendition is available. The system will not try to create a rendition when the rendition content element is written by the client. The actual rendering will be done by the Document Conversion Service. Which conversions are supported, depends on the plugins available on the classpath of the service. When the creation of a rendition fails, the system will re-try to create the rendition. The number of re-tries can be configured, the default is three (see configuration properties). When all retries have failed, the rendition message will be added to a dead letter queue and the status field of the rendition will be set to -1 (FAILED). For this to work, the message queue in ActiveMQ must be configured to use an individual dead letter queue as described in the ActiveMQ documentation. <policyEntry queue=\"ecr-queue-create-renditions\"> <deadLetterStrategy> <individualDeadLetterStrategy queuePrefix=\"DLQ.\" useQueueForQueueMessages=\"true\"/> </deadLetterStrategy> </policyEntry> The status of failed renditions can be set to RESET (-2) either by using the API method de.eitco.ecr.sdk.document.TypedDocumentServiceClient.resetFailedRenditionStatus or simply by setting the value in the database directly. A system job polls the database and will enqueue new rendition messages in ActiveMQ to re-try to create the renditions. The interval in which the job polls the database can be configured using the parameter retry-renditions.cron-expression (see configuration properties). There are cases where the decision, whether to create a rendition for a content element, can only be made at run-time. For cases like this a type can provide a method implementing that decision. This method is marked by the annotation @RenditionCreationCondition. Only one method of a type may have this annotation. The method must have the return type boolean, java.lang.Boolean or kotlin.Boolean In case it is java.lang.Boolean it may not return null must not be abstract should the defining class be an interface this means that it is either a static or a default-method note that - should the type be defined in kotlin and the method not be static - this means it has to be compiled with -Xjvm-default=all or -Xjvm-default=all-compatibility can have up to two parameters of type RenditionInfo The first representing the source to render And the second representing the target to render to if only one parameter is given it is assumed to be the source If such a method exists, arveo evaluates it before posting rendition messages. If the method returns false the message is not posted. Such a method may be present on types that are not Documents, but will not have any effect. This might be helpful in scenarios where there are complex inheritance structures. Let’s assume a scenario where we have a document with a content element \"content\" that can have an arbitrary type. It is supposed to be a multi-page document, so in most cases it is a pdf-file. However, there are cases where a document is created with the content element being an MS-word document and in some cases it is just a single page image. Even multi-page tiffs are possible and in some seldom cases the content is unclear and simply \"application/octet-stream\". In this scenario there is a web viewer that is supposed to show the documents content. For the viewer, pdf files are no problem whatsoever. It is fully capable to view the images also, except multiple-page tiff files that pose a problem. It is unable to view ms-office files. And for \"application/octet-stream\" it can only provide a download link. Thus is decided that the backend needs to create a pdf rendition for ms-office formats and tiff files. This could be implemented with the following class: @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = \"content\") (1) @Rendition(name = \"rendition\", sourceElement = \"content\", contentType = MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF_VALUE) (2) public interface DocumentWithDynamicRenditionDecision { String getName(); void setName(String name); @RenditionCreationCondition default boolean decideRendition( (3) RenditionInfo source, RenditionInfo target (4) ) { if (source.getMediaType().equals(\"application/msword\")) { (5) return true; } if (source.getMediaType().equals(\"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\")) { return true; } if (source.getMediaType().equals(\"image/tiff\")) { return true; } return false; } } 1 A content element with the name \"content\" is defined. 2 A pdf rendition of that element is defined with the name \"rendition\". 3 A default method \"decideRendition\" is created and marked with @RenditionCreationCondition. Note that: Its return type is boolean. as a default method it is not abstract it hast two parameters of the type RenditionInfo Thus, it is applicable. 4 Note that the second parameter is unused. It could be omitted. 5 The implementation of the method is pretty simple. It checks whether the mime-type of the source element is one that we want to create a rendition for - ms-word files (old and new) or tif. If so, it returns true indicating that the arveo should create a rendition for the element. Otherwise, it returns false so that no rendition is created. Assume the application described in example 1. Assume further that at one point it becomes necessary to migrate some older documents to this application. An importer is written, however most of the imports fail. This is due to the fact that many of the documents are in an older msword format that the current render engine is incapable of transforming into pdf. So it is decided to not create a rendition for those elements and simply provide a download link in the applications' client. This poses a problem in the decideRendition() method: Ms word documents that are created from the old source still should have created a rendition for. Thus, it is not possible to decide whether to render from the source type alone. A simple solution for this could be to add a new property create_rendition to the type. This nullable boolean could be set when created to imply whether to create a rendition for the content element or not. A value of null would activate the behaviour already implemented: @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement(name = \"content\") @Rendition(name = \"rendition\", sourceElement = \"content\", contentType = MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF_VALUE) public interface DynamicRenditionExample2 { String getName(); void setName(String name); (1) Boolean getCreateRendition(); void setCreateRendition(Boolean value); @RenditionCreationCondition default boolean decideRendition( RenditionInfo source (2) ) { if (getCreateRendition() != null) { (3) return getCreateRendition(); } (4) if (source.getMediaType().equals(\"application/msword\")) { return true; } if (source.getMediaType().equals(\"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\")) { return true; } if (source.getMediaType().equals(\"image/tiff\")) { return true; } return false; } } 1 The property create_rendition is defined. Note that with the type java.lang.Boolean it is nullable. 2 Note that in this case the unused parameter is omitted. This is the only change in the method signature. 3 At the start of the method, it is checked, whether the new property is set, simply by calling the getter. If so the value is returned. 4 Otherwise, the code from example 1 is executed. The rendition feature can be used to store extracted fulltext data as content elements of a document. To achieve this, simply add a rendition content element with the content type text/plain. The content types of the source content element that can be used for text-extraction depend on the available extraction plugins of the Document Conversion Service.","title":"Renditions","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"renditions","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-administration/renditions.html","titles":[{"text":"Error handling","hash":"error_handling","id":1},{"text":"Reset status of failed renditions","hash":"reset_status_of_failed_renditions","id":2},{"text":"Dynamically skipping renditions","hash":"dynamically_skipping_renditions","id":3},{"text":"Example 1","hash":"example_1","id":4},{"text":"Example 2","hash":"example_2","id":5},{"text":"Text renditions","hash":"text_renditions","id":6}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Once you have deployed your new data type with enabled retention, all your data is stored in your default storage profile and has a default retention of 10 years.

For the installation of the product, certain requirements for the hardware, software and infrastructure to be provided must be met. In a typical cloud environment each arveo service is deployed as a containerized application and is hosted and scaled by a cloud operating system. However, a different setup can be used, depending on the customer infrastructure and the load of the system (see Deployment Options) The following chapter describes the minimum CPU and RAM requirements of each arveo service in a production environment. Content services requirements Service CPU RAM Document Service 4 x> 2 GHz >= 32 GB Registry Service 1x > 2 GHz >= 512 MB Config Service 1x > 2 GHz >= 512 MB Audit Service 1x > 2 GHz >= 512 MB SAP Archive Link Service (optional) 1x > 2 GHz >= 1 GB Document Conversion Service (optional) 1x > 2 GHz >= 2 GB Federation Service (optional) 1x > 2 GHz >= 2 GB The number of started services for each service group and the assigned CPU and RAM depends very much on the load and the number of documents and objects in the database. You should always monitor the system and scale up or down on demand. Especially service like document conversion or enterprise integration service can produce heavy load and require a lot of containers consuming RAM and CPU. For a test or development system the requirements are lower and each service requires: < 1 CPU, 256 MB for all services. Assuming that the installation is performed as spring boot services we recommend to set up a minimum of 3 machines. The database and the document service carry the highest load and should be deployed on separate machines. All other services and 3rd party services can run on one OS instance. Some services like Archive Link, Document Conversion may consume high CPU and RAM and can make it necessary to outsource them to separate machines, System machine 1 - database. The PostgreSQL database is installed here. Requirements for the database machine Component Recommendation Note CPU 4x (> 2 GHz) RAM At least 16 GB Depending on the size of the database DB Storage Proportional to the number and the kind of the entities Recommendation: should be stored on separate storage Log files Depending on the volume of changes to the database Recommendation: Should be stored on separate storage OS Ubuntu The operating system recommendation is optional, hence any system satisfying the requirements of the PostgreSQL database may be installed System machine 2 - Document Service is installed here.

ECR-1477: Unique constraint on creator user disables updates on type Fixed a bug that caused updates to fail when a unique constraint was added to a system field. ECR-1478: Forward events to a message queue Events can now be forwarded to ActiveMQ message queues. ECR-1481: Added support for PDF and HTML renditions of X-Rechnung documents It is now possible to automatically create PDF or HTML renditions of XML documents conforming to X-Rechnung standard. ECR-1484: Check content length information from client The server now checks the content size of uploaded content that was declared by the client. If the size does not match the actual size, an exception will be thrown. ECR-1491: Added possibility to configure database timeouts Timeouts for SQL statements and/or transactions can now be configured. ECR-1493: Fixed publishing of delete content events Events related to the deletion of content are fired again. ECR-1494: New system job to delete abandoned objects in storage A new system job was added that can delete abandoned objects in storage profiles. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes The property for the system ID for the jobs of the Content Repository Service running in an external Job Service instance was changed from ecr.jobs.external.system-id to ecr.system.system-id. Manual migration steps Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-274: Added support for case-insensitive string array attributes It is now possible to perform case-insensitive queries on string array attributes. ECR-1458: Content of documents deleted by cascading foreign key was not removed Content elements of documents deleted on the database and not using the API will now be removed from the storage. ECR-1459: Batch Api: order operations in dependency order Every call of the batch api now orders the batches elements so that attribute references are honoured i.e. should element a refer to element b it is assured that element b is executed before element a. ECR-1463: Improved behavior of delete and purge methods The behavior of the delete- and purge-methods was improved to avoid misunderstandings and leftover content elements in the storage system. The content of deleted documents will now always be deleted from the storage, too. For details see documentation. ECR-1472: Updated to Spring Boot 3.4 Spring Boot was updated to version 3.4. Spring Cloud was updated to version 2024.0. ECR-1473: Internal and external job scheduler can now be used simultaneously It is now possible to use both the internal and the external job scheduler simultaneously. Interface breaking changes The recovery table feature was removed. The method to clean up the recovery table was removed from the system management API. We recommend regular backups of the database- and storage-system instead. The compliance-delete feature was removed. The associated system field and the complianceDelete API methods have been removed. Configuration changes The configuration option for the asynchronous mode of the retention cleanup job was removed. Instead, the job can now use the purge method instead of the delete method to achieve a similar behavior. Manual migration steps The name of the internal Quartz scheduler used in the Content Repository Service was changed from quartzScheduler to content-repository-service-scheduler. All triggers for the system jobs will be re-created with the new scheduler name automatically. Manual changes made to the old triggers have to be applied manually to the newly created triggers if required. Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1431: Actuator endpoints can now be secured using OAuth2 It is now possible to secure actuator endpoints (except info and health) using OAuth2. A user or service accessing secured actuator endpoints must have a configurable authority. ECR-1435: Removed ActiveMQ dependency from HTTP SDK The dependency to activemq-client was removed from the HTTP SDK. ECR-1439: Removed SOLR integration The SOLR integration was removed. The full text features of the PostgreSQL database can be used instead. ECR-1448: Full text data not extracted after update Full text data was not extracted when a client performed an update immediately after the creation of a new document. ECR-1137: Initial upload for scenario data A command line shell tool was implemented capable of importing scenario data ECR-1455: Limit number of IDs in delete requests for S3 and Azure Blob Storage plugins The number of IDs contained in one delete request sent to an S3 or Azure Blob Storage instance are now limited. Larger lists will be split into several requests. ECR-1456: Split messages for purge and delete-recycled queues Messages containing many entity IDs are now split into several messages with a configurable number of IDs. Interface breaking changes The classes EcrJmsDestinations, EcrJmsQueueNames and ObjectMessagePayload were moved from ecr-commons to ecr-jms. The package of these classes is now de.eitco.ecr.jms. Type definition interfaces that used the @NoSQL annotation or full text extraction must be adapted: The @NoSQL annotation has to be removed. Full text extraction is now configured as shown in the example below: @ContentElement(name = \"content\", fulltextExtraction = @FullTextExtraction(fullTextLanguage = FullTextLanguage.ENGLISH)) Configuration changes The deprecated setting for the migrated tenant ID was removed. A system ID must now be configured for each system: ecr: server: system: system-id: 0 The system ID is of type short and is used to guarantee that entity IDs of different systems are unique. This makes it possible to merge two systems at some time in the future. The old default value was 0.

ECR-1350: Add API methods to retrieve full text data Added new API methods to retrieve full text data stored in the relational database. ECR-1359: Validation support for type definition interfaces It is now possible to define SpEL expressions to validate attribute values in create and update operations. ECR-1404: Get additional user identifiers from modification information A client can now get the additional user identifiers from an entity’s modification information. ECR-1409: Added system job to retry failed full text extractions Failed full text extractions can now be retried using a system job. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes Manual migration steps Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1385: Schema creation using JOOQ The creation of the tables, indexes, sequences etc. for type definitions now uses JOOQ to access the database. The system will no longer generate Liquibase scripts for type definitions. ECR-1282: Upgrade to Java 21 arveo now uses Java version 21 and can use virtual threads to improve the performance in situations with many parallel requests. Java versions prior to 21 can no longer be used to run arveo. ECR-1329: Simplified security configuration The configuration property security.general.open-ant-matchers was removed. From now on, all paths not matched by the matchers configured in security.general.secured-ant-matchers do not require authentication. ECR-1393: Fixed quoting of enum type names Enumeration type names were not quoted correctly when the database schema is created. This caused enum types with custom names using upper and lower case letters to be created even when they already existed. Interface breaking changes The FileSystemPluginChangeSetSupplier interface was removed. Storage plugins, that need to modify the database schema, can now use the interface StoragePluginSchemaModifier to modify the schema using JOOQ. The streaming endpoint’s URL was change from /api/streaming to /streaming. Configuration changes The property liquibase.initializer.enabled was renamed to schema.initializer.enabled. The configuration property security.general.open-ant-matchers was removed. Manual migration steps ECR-1393 Enum definitions using custom names (@Enumeration annotation) with upper case letters must either be changed to an all lower case name or the name of the type on the database must be changed manually before the update. Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1342: Added ability to store extracted full text data in Postgres database It is now possible to store extracted full text data in the Postgres database. ECR-1343: EQL now supports searching for full text in Postgres database The EQL can now be used to search for full text matches in the Postgres database using Postgres' web search feature. ECR-1358: Performance optimizations for like, startsWith and endsWith queries Case-insensitive like-, startsWith- and endsWith-queries can now use text matching indexes on the database. ECR-1360: Added missing not-null constraint on latest_version_id column A missing not-null constraint was added to the latest_version_id column and the existing unique index for this column was replaced by a unique constraint. ECR-1361: Ranking full text search results The rank of full text search results can now be calculated and used for ordering (for the Postgres database). ECR-1345: Highlighting full text search results The system can now generate a headline for each query result that highlights matches words (for the Postgres database). ECR-1380: System separation in ActiveMQ It is now possible to use one ActiveMQ cluster for multiple arveo systems. ECR-1388: Fixed SOLR health indicator The SOLR health indicator was fixed. added code generator for types safe eql extension Interface breaking changes Configuration changes The naming of the queues in ActiveMQ was changed to support the usage of one ActiveMQ cluster with multiple arveo systems. Each queue is now prefixed with a system ID. The dead letter queue names now use the DLQ suffix instead of the DLQ prefix. Therefore, the policy entries for the dead letter queue stategies have to be changed. The new policies can be found in the documentation. The system will create the new queues automatically. The old queues can be deleted manually. Make sure that the queues are empty before updating the system. Otherwise, queued jobs like automatic rendition creation might be lost. The property ecr.server.system.migration.main-migrated-tenant-numerical-id has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. The system ID can now be configured using the property ecr.server.system.system-id. Manual migration steps Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1303: Added non-spring java client A new client library without dependencies to the Spring framework was added. The library uses the generic low-level API. ECR-1316: Removed ACL feature and dependencies to internal user management The ACL feature was removed. Access rights are managed using attribute based access control now. The arveo services are now completely independent of the internal user management and can be used with any AuthX service supporting OAuth2. The User Management Service is now deprecated and should not be used in production environments anymore. ECR-1322: Added feature to define security attributes It is now possible to mark properties as security-properties. Security property values can only be changed by users with CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS authority. ECR-1335: Removed legacy tenant separation feature The integrated tenant separation by a system defined user attribute and database column was removed. Tenants can still be separated by a custom attribute using ABAC, by separate type definitions or by separate service instances using a different database. ECR-1344: Added support for text similarity indexes Support for special indexes to speed up text similarity determination was added. On Postgres, GIN indexes with trigram ops can be created automatically unsing the new @IndexedForTextMatching annotation. An EndsWithExpression was added to the EQL to provide a convenient way to match strings with a leading wildcard. ECR-1355: Duplicate index on primary key id The system will no longer create duplicate unique indexes for the ID column. Interface breaking changes The support for ACLs was removed. This affects all entity input types (except for meta-data-types). API methods for ACL management have been removed, too. Authentication related classes like CommonAuthentication and ExternalUserDetails have been moved to another package (de.eitco.commons.spring.authentication). The id field of the CommonAuthentication has been changed to String to support generic IDs. The internal ID of type long is now contained in the field internalId. The classes ModificationStamp and UserId have been moved to the package de.eitco.ecr.common. The AclRight enumeration was renamed to AccessRight. The AuthenticationContext class for ABAC security methods now provides convenience methods to access the CommonAuthentication in the spring security context. Other members of the class were removed. ACL-related type definition annotations have been removed. The system property name INITIAL_CREATION_USER was renamed to INITIAL_CREATION_USER_ID to avoid problems when using generated JOOQ records as type definitions. The annotation GenerateNameConstants was moved to the package de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.processor in the new module ecr-type-definition-processor. The unused annotation AttributeDefinitionName was removed. Use Name instead. Formatted counters now are treated as case-insensitive. Configuration changes The services no longer require a specific authority to authorize a request. Access to different services can still be controlled using the audience (aud) claim of the JWT. If the old behavior is still required, it can be activated by configuring the required authority as shown below: security: general: role-for-secured-access: \"REQUIRED_AUTHORITY\" Manual migration steps Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1331: Better support for impersonated userd in ABAC It is now possible to get the original user token of an impersonated user in ABAC security methods. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes Manual migration steps Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1323: New \"Release Note\" page on arveo GitHub page Beginning from version 16.1.0, we add release notes as new GitHub page. ECR-1328 New system field for the initial creation user id A new system field was added that stores the ID of the user who created the initial version of an entity. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes Manual migration steps ECR-1328 added a new system field, which requires a manual migration for existing database tables. The new field contains the ID of the user who created the initial version of an entity. The following script can be used to migrate existing tables: do $$ declare rec record; begin for rec in select distinct \"table_name\" FROM \"information_schema\".\"columns\" WHERE \"table_schema\"='integrationtest' AND \"column_name\"='version_number' and \"table_name\" not like '%_ver' and \"table_name\" not like '%_con' loop execute format('alter table \"%1$s\" add column \"initial_creation_user_id\" int8', rec.table_name); execute format('update \"%1$s\" set \"initial_creation_user_id\" = (select \"creator_user_id\" from \"%1$s_ver\" v where v.\"entity_id\" = \"id\" and v.\"version_number\" = 1)', rec.table_name); execute format('alter table \"%1$s\" alter column \"initial_creation_user_id\" set not null', rec.table_name); end loop; end $$; Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1291: Unchanged type definitions no longer cause entries in the databasechangelog table. ECR-1301: Fixed a bug that caused missing entries in the content tables after a batch update. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes ECR-1260: ACLs are now disabled by default. Beginning from version 16.0.0, the ACL feature is now disabled by default for a type definition. The @AclDisabled annotation is no longer checked and can be removed. Instead, to enable ACLs, add the @Acls annotation to all type definitions that use ACLs. To disable ACLs for a type definition that had the ACL feature enabled it is necessary to drop the acl_id column from the type definition’s main table manually from the database. Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1242: Added support for variables. ECR-1283: Added support for variables in SOLR. ECR-1292: Service won’t try to render content elements that cannot be rendered anymore. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes To be able to store variables in SOLR, the managed-schema configuration file for SOLR must be adapted. Variables are stored as dynamic fields in SOLR, so one dynamic field for each type of variable must be added: <dynamicField name=\"*_integer.var\" type=\"integer\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_long.var\" type=\"long\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_double.var\" type=\"double\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_date.var\" type=\"date\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_boolean.var\" type=\"boolean\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_uuid.var\" type=\"uuid\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_string.var\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <dynamicField name=\"*_lowercase.var\" type=\"lowercase\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1299: Improved handling of ACL right calculation to avoid system blockage due to long running transactions. ECR-1300: Added configuration option for batch operation limit. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes ECR-1300 added configuration option for batch operation limit. The batch operation limit can now be configured using the property ecr.server.system.batch-operation-limit. The default value is 100000. To disable the limit, set the property to -1.

ECR-1200: Fixed potential insertion of outdated data in NOSQL database. ECR-1202: Added switches to disable individual message listeners. ECR-1254: Content access tokens now work with external OAuth user authentication. ECR-1255: Service now contains a Swagger UI. ECR-1257: Added endpoint that returns possible type definition access right values. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes ECR-1200 fixed potential insertion of outdated data in NOSQL database. The fix requires changes in the SOLR configuration. Add the following field in managed-schema: <field name=\"nosql_version_number\" type=\"integer\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" required=\"true\" multiValued=\"false\" /> Add the following entry in solrconfig.xml: <updateRequestProcessorChain name=\"docCentricVersioning\"> <processor class=\"solr.DocBasedVersionConstraintsProcessorFactory\"> <str name=\"versionField\">nosql_version_number</str> <bool name=\"ignoreOldUpdates\">true</bool> <bool name=\"supportMissingVersionOnOldDocs\">true</bool> </processor> <processor class=\"solr.LogUpdateProcessorFactory\" /> <processor class=\"solr.RunUpdateProcessorFactory\" /> </updateRequestProcessorChain> For more details see: https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/indexing-guide/partial-document-updates.html#document-centric-versioning-constraints ECR-1166 added initial creation date to modification information. Use a getter of type EcrModificationInformation for the system property MODIFICATION_INFO to access the initial creation date. Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1109: Updated to Spring Boot 3.1. ECR-1192: Simplified internal job authentication. ECR-1206: Implemented resumable uploads. ECR-1207: Better error message when data types in query parameters do not match. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes Migration guide for arveo version 14.0.0 The following steps are necessary when updating to arveo version 14.0.0. Use a Java 17 runtime. arveo 14.0.0 cannot run on Java 11. Adapt your Spring Boot Starter used to register type definitions according to the [Spring Boot Migration Guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide#auto-configuration-files). Install the new [Authorization Service](https://git.eitco.de/projects/CMN/repos/authorization-service/browse) Migrate OAuth client configuration The Authorization Server feature (including the management of OAuth Clients) has been removed from the User Management Service and has to be migrated to the new Authorization Service. OAuth Clients stored in the database will be removed (the entire table will be dropped). The Authorization Service uses the standard Spring Boot configuration mechanism to load registered clients. A sample configuration file can be found in test/basic-environment-test/tests/src/test/resource-templates/config/authorization-service.yaml The Authorization Service uses an embedded User Management Service to access the user database. Configuration properties for the User Management Service contained in test/basic-environment-test/tests/src/test/resource-templates/config/application.yaml are read by the Authorization Service, too! The User Management Service now uses the same OAuth2 implementation as the other services. The configuration has to be adapted accordingly. See test/basic-environment-test/tests/src/test/resource-templates/config/user-management-service.yaml for an example. Migrate configuration for file- and request-size limits. arveo now uses the default Spring configuration properties: `yaml spring: servlet: multipart: max-file-size: 100MB max-request-size: 100MB ` New authentication for jobs running in the embedded job scheduler (ECR-1192) Jobs running in the embedded job scheduler now use an internal authentication mechanism and no longer require the configured job user. On systems without a standalone Job Service, the job user can be removed.

Interface breaking changes Configuration changes Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1193: Several fixes for JOOQ records used as type definitions. ECR-1198: Content information is now stored in SOLR. Interface breaking changes Configuration changes ECR-1198 The content information of document type objects is now stored in a field called \"content\" in SOLR. The default schema configuration already contains a field called \"content\" with a different data type. This field has to be removed, as the used data type uses tokenizing. The provided schema configuration in the tests module was changed accordingly. Details Finished stories and bugs ECR-1184: Enhanced handling of content references for solr.

Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web. OWASP is dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security (https://owasp.org). What does Eitco to develop, operate and maintain a secure content service platform? we only use Opensource Software from secure and accepted projects like Apache or Spring. we implemented an open source review and monitor process Software architecture review by the Eitco software architects security check using OWASP dependency check legal licence check to ensure that it is a real open source project on the long term. we continuously check our open source dependencies with reference to architecture, security leaks, maintainability. to ensure that all known vulnerabilities of 3rd party open source projects are eliminated we integrated the OWASP dependency-check tool in our nightly build. Dependency check checks our dependencies against a database with all known vulnerabilities. in case a severe vulnerability is found we take the appropriate countermeasures. provide a security path for our customers with a new version of the 3rd party library change the implementation or configuration using the 3rd party component inform our customers to update or reconfigure components like database, message queue, application server, etc. replace the 3rd party component.

When a version is created the content or metadata is stored as a traceable and immutable version (Versioning) to the database and storage system. That means that we have separate content objects and database entries for each version. Each document can have a retention period that ensures that the document cannot be deleted before the period expires. You can delete or purge any object with the arveo Delete-API if you have the DELETE right for the document type and the entity and the retention period has not expired. The delete method deletes all entities including all versions of the object in the database. The content is removed from the object storage asynchronously. The delete operation cannot be restored and the data is permanently deleted. The purge method additionally erases the content objects or files from the content storage immediately. Any document, container or folder type can use the optional recycle bin feature. If it is enabled, entities in the type definition can be moved to and restored from the recycle bin. The recycle bin is implemented as a boolean database system property DELETED. Entities in the recycle bin will be filtered from normal queries by default, but a client can compose search expressions that override this behavior (see Recycle Bin). If you delete or purge an object in the recycle bin it is deleted like a document without recycle bin feature and cannot be restored. For compliance reasons the audit entries in the database are not deleted by the Delete-API and the delete operation written to the audit log. The operator of the platform must clean up the audit table after the legal retention period has expired. We recommend backing up the audit logs to meet the legal requirements of data protection and to ensure that the backups can be restored within the legal retention period. It is possible to empty your recycle bin by an automated job scheduled in the Enterprise Integration Service of arveo.You can activate the predefined empty recycle bin job, and you can change the age from the 6 months default value to the age you choose.

All revisions of content or metadata are stored as a traceable and immutable version (Versioning) to the storage systems. The content service checks the integrity of uploaded content by computing SHA-256 hashes on client and server side. Additionally, an audit entry is written to the audit log table (Audit Log). _arveo provides a role based access control on object level and allows you to prevent unauthorized access to content and metadata. arveo protects content and metadata by software design. arveo only allows access to content and metadata via the arveo REST API. As only arveo and highly authorized administrators have data writer rights for the database and the storage it is impossible that content is deleted or manipulated by unauthorized persons. Together with arveo's capabilities to manage the retention periods of documents and records (Retention Periods) _arveo guarantees a GDPR and/or DSGVO compliant data protection and data privacy. arveo meets the the requirements of a revision proof long term archive and is a corner stone for the legal compliance of your IT systems. Because the new legal data privacy / protection act makes it necessary to erase data even before the expected retention period has expired arveo does not use hardware retention features. If needed you can add verifiable evidence records to the documents (signatures, timestamps) to proof the integrity and authenticity of content and author. The creation of the evidence is not a feature of arveo . It only stores the record together with the content. In this chapter you will find all information how to setup a secure and legally compliant content service platform with arveo. arveo distinguishes three kinds of data and stores each to the most suitable storage system. Content: arveo stores unstructured content like documents, audio, video and images to either a cloud object storage or a file system storage. Most cloud providers like AWS S3, NetAPP ONTAP, EMC Elastic Cloud, etc. provide file system storage or object storage systems. Object storages are organized in buckets and allow you to store an almost unlimited numbers of objects in a bucket. arveo accesses the content via REST Standard S3. Structured system properties: containing all primary keys and technical information about documents, containers and folders. The data has a fix data model and requires highest performance, consistency and transaction support. arveo saves the data on a relational database. Customer specific metadata: The data model is different for each document, container or folder type. This metadata is semi structured and new properties might be added during the life cycle of the application. Consistent customer keys: The properties require highest performance, consistancy and transaction support. arveo saves the data on a relational database. The high availability (HA) of arveo depends highly on the HA of the storage systems for all kind of data. Each of the storage systems and as a result the arveo services follow the CAP (Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance) theorem saying that the availability and fail safety of a system depend on: Consistency: All clients see the same content and metadata. Availability: All clients can read and write. Partition Tolerance: the system is fail safe when one or more nodes fail. The CAP theorem in a nutshell predicts that you cannot have all three properties but only two of them. As arveo is a ECM cloud platform consistency and availability (read/write) of content and metadata are most important. arveo tolerates that network or message failure of either the primary content storage or database node can cause exceptions on the client application. The arveo services do not store data within their containers and focus on scalability and partition tolerance. The arveo micro services should be deployed as containers in your cloud environment (e.g. kubernetes) and auto scaling should be implemented. arveo ensures the immutability and integrity of all your digital content and evidence records by an automated hash check each time content is up- or downloaded. Hash-Check: When you use the upload content API, the client side and content service compute SHA-256 hash for the streamed data. Only if both values are identical the upload process is successful. The upload API allows you to pass the expected SHA-256 value and the API will only return OK if the server side hash matches the expected hash. Verify: The upload API optionally can verify the uploaded content. The content service downloads the just uploaded stream from the content storage and compares the hash once again with the expected value (Upload Content). _arveo stores the hash value in a system property and persists the value in the document type metadata table. The verify option of the Upload API may slow down your system when uploading a huge amount of data. The arveo REST API is stateless and there is no session. That means that all REST API calls are atomic and all database commands are executed within one transaction. arveo guarantees the atomicity of the transactions and to avoid inconsistent states, all aborted transactions are removed and rolled back. Hanging transactions are removed and rolled back to avoid database locks. The database provider should configure the transaction deadlock timeout on your database to avoid locks on the database that can decrease the performance of your UPDATE and DELETE calls. When you use the download API (Download Content) the client SDK computes the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded stream and compares it to the hash value in the system property of the document type. If the hash does not match the upload hash value in the database the download fails with a data integrity exception telling the caller that the data on the storage was most likely manipulated. An administrator only can illegally manipulate content if he can access both database and content storage because the control hash value of the content is stored in the database. Take care that none of your administrators has exclusive and unattended access to the content storage and the database. Distributed management roles of the storage systems and the arveo transparent encryption feature can make your system forgery-proof! arveo support evidence proof long term storage of your content and metadata by storing the content legally secure to either a S3 object storage or a file system. The storage must be redundant. Object storage systems like AWS, NetAPP or EMC Elastic Cloud Storage guarantee the long term availability and integrity of your content. All changes of content or metadata are persisted as a traceable and immutable version (Versioning) on your storage system and an audit entry is written to the audit log table (Audit Log). _arveo creates a version each time metadata including comments and annotations or content of a document is changed by the API arveo} creates a new entry containing the author and the timestamp pf the change in the version management table. The Update API allows you to add a comment to each version. The Version Management API provides access to all version information and metadata and content of previous versions. To ensure that the content is immutable only arveo should have write access to the storage system. Only authorized data protection officers & administrators should have write-access to the storage system. In case of very sensible data you can enable encryption (Encryption) to follow the data protection rules and prevent your administrators from access of document content. For best high availability the provider of your storage system must protect the stored data against accidental, malicious, or disaster-induced loss of data. The better your data replication the better is your availability in case of a failure. For both supported storages (S3, file system) you can select between different data replication strategies: Backup or Mirror enables an asynchronous disaster recovery. Your content data is periodically mirrored and the data; Synchronous replication; Asynchronous replication. As arveo stores each version of the content as an immutable object it is not possible that clients will get outdated data. If the replication is asynchronous it only can happen that clients get a read error. In case the storage is offline arveo is not available and the system has an outage. In case the storage allows only read access arveo can download content but upload operations fail. If the storage node has a long term outage the potential data loss is limited by the time that has passed since the last replication and the number of objects stored since that time. We strongly recommend using a redundant file system or object storage system. If you do not at least backup your data periodically a data loss is likely. For high availability with almost zero data loss your storage system should replicate the written content and data synchronously. The operating team of the platform must ensure that an appropriate replication is set up and monitored. You can configure different storage location (Cloud-Storage or on premise) for your content and document types (Storage Configuration). Reduce costs by storing non compliant and legally relevant data like PDF/A renditions of documents on storage systems with lower availability and performance SLAs. Object storages with REST APIs are designed for the cloud. If you decide to use storage from the Cloud (public or private) we recommend to use object storage via S3 API. Object storages provide a high level of redundancy (even geo redundant) and fail safety. The REST S3 API is very tolerant against network and infrastructure failures. The relational database PostgreSQL 17.0 is responsible for 100% consistent processing of the structured metadata and transactions. For the supported databases PostgreSQL 17.0 you can select between different data replication strategies: Asynchronous replication (backup or mirror): Enables an asynchronous disaster recovery. Your database is periodically mirrored. Synchronous database cluster: Transactions are synchronously replicated on more than one master node. The provider of the PostgreSQL 17.0 cluster must guarantee that data is stored redundant and reduce potential data loss. In case the database cluster is down or allows only read access arveo is not available (Deny Of Service/DOS). If the database has a long term outage and the data files are affected the potential data loss is limited by the time that has passed since the last replication and the number of objects stored since that time. In case the database cluster is down arveo is still available but free customer searches fail. In case one database node is down or the database is read only arveo is still available but searches may return outdated results. If the database has a long term outage and the data files are affected the potential data loss is limited by the time that has passed since the last replication and the number of objects stored since that time. Each arveo service can be configured as a service cluster to achieve HA. Depending on the deployment you can either set up an application server cluster (WAR deployment) or run our containerized applications on a cloud platform like open-stack with kubernetes.

In addition to the proper use of the arveo and 3rd party services, we recommend implementing these measures when using Eitco as compliant repository for legally compliant storage of records and documents. To allow users and 3rd party applications to identify and find objects in arveo you should define a unique and immutable unique identifier property (Data Modelling). The property must be @Unique to ensure that a user or business application can clearly identify the item. The unique identifier should use the taxonomy of business processes and contain all information to clearly recognize the document. Make the property @Readonly to ensure that the identifier is always set and immutable. The minimizes the risk of incorrect indexing and undetectability of documents because the index is immutable, duplicate identifiers are rejected and the compliant taxonomy ensures that every user can find documents easy and fast. We strongly recommend building a documented, simple but clear taxonomy. Your business application or the user must set the value when the object is created (@Mandatory annotation), or you can let arveo create a unique value by adding counter annotations. Add the @Autoincrement annotation if a simple sequential Long id meets your requirements. If you need a more sophisticated unique identifier you can use the annotation _@FormattedCounter which allows you to create e.g. String identifiers like <year>-<sequence> (Unique Identifier Example) List data types allow you to store more than String or long value for a property. You can search for each value using the array search operation of the arveo query language (Data Types). Enumeration data types allow you to set one or more values from a fixed set of values. Enable that the statutory retention periods are assigned to the records, cases and document types (Retention Periods, Retention Rules) and ensure that the storage container are configured correctly (Retention Container) . Check if the technically assigned retention periods also correspond to the statutory retention periods. Monitor the audit logs to ensure that the retention period is set and is correct. Monitoring could be automated or could be a random control by an employee. The operating team must ensure that storage container contain only documents with the same retention period. Please do not use the same bucket in different storage profiles or assign a storage profile containing content with retention to different document types. Grant the deletion right for your storage containers to arveo. If arveo cannot delete the containers, your operating team is in charge of this task, and you must set the option delete rows only. Configuring storage containers in arveo-service.yaml and your content storage is an ongoing task for your operating team. Eitco will try to create the buckets or subdirectory on your storage system but can also use already existing ones. It must be ensured that the system time cannot be manipulated (e.g. NTP server). Suitable map measures that a change in the system time is detected promptly. Because the new legal data privacy / protection act makes it necessary to erase data even before the expected retention period has expired arveo please take care that the content storage has no default hardware retention activated. Enable the audit option for all types containing legally compliant content (Audit Log). If the platform is operated safely (Platform Security) users and applications can exclusively write content and metadata using the arveo REST API. arveo logs all user or application update operations of content and metadata to the audit table. All changes of content or metadata are persisted as a traceable and immutable version (Versioning) on your storage system and an audit entry is written to the audit log table (Audit Log) containing the author and the timestamp of the change. If a document is updated the version is incremented and saved in the version number. Although all version are traceable and accessible by the API we recommend making the version number system property visible in the application to identify copies of the original easily. Ensure that the @Overwrite option is not set for legally compliant document types. If overwrite is turned on it is possible to manipulate the originally saved content and compromise the document without creating a versioned copy. The audit logs are subject to the retention period of commercial and tax law. Ensure that the audit logs are kept for the legal retention period (10 years). We recommend that the operator of the platform exports and clears the audit tables using database tools after 2 years. Save the dumps as an arveo document with a 10-year retention period. If you need access to older audit logs you easily download the dumps and upload them to the database. The audit tables must be protected against unauthorized access by users. Do not allow write-access to the audit tables to anyone but the arveo services. Only data protection officers are allowed to have controlled read access to the audit data. Check the audit logs regularly to find unauthorized user activities. All documents in arveo that are subject to retention are available by the REST API and can be downloaded. The integrity and availability of the content is the responsibility of the provider and operator of the platform. The provider must ensure that failures of the storage systems for database and content are identified at an early stage and take appropriate countermeasures. See chapter Fail Safety for technical and organizational measures for high availability of the arveo platform. In the event that data has to be migrated, arveo offers an extensive export API that enables content and metadata to be exported. arveo saves the hash value (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) in the database that was determined when the content was first uploaded (Upload Data). This hash value can be used as a checksum to detect accidental or intentionally corruption of data. If the hash value of the content after the migration is identical to the original hash the migration report proves the correctness of the migration process. To report the completeness of the migration process the _arveo API allows you to export a list of all records, cases and documents in a document type. Prerequisite for the migration use verify and best hash check possible in your solution when uploading content to arveo. During the migration download content and metadata (including the original hash and retention period) upload metadata and content to the migrated platform and set the retention period to the exact same value. calculate hash of the migrated platform by downloading the content After the migration Correctness: compare hash, metadata and retention period for each original and migrated record, case and document. Completeness: check that each migrated document can be found using the unique identifier Traceability: Create a report for each document type. Report the content hash evidence and the metadata for all migrated objects. Upload the migration report to the migrated platform and set the retention period to the retention date of the document with the longest retention period within the report. Depending on your retention policy you can create separate reports for a retention period range (e.g. by year). arveo guarantees high availability, reliability and high performance at all times. The system has to be protected from manipulation attempts by proven and well-thought concepts. The data that is stored and managed in the system is protected via the API. The access and editing rights are managed via attribute based access control. User rights are based on the developed concepts for users, groups and security attributes. More detailed information on this is provided in the relevant chapters of this manual. Access to all data (documents, metadata) takes place exclusively via the API, with the corresponding protection mechanisms so that the security of the data is guaranteed at all times. The operator must take appropriate technical or organizational measures to ensure that the data is stored in the storage in such a way that it cannot be changed within the legally prescribed retention period. Enable the verify option for all clients and integrations. The upload API optionally can verify the uploaded content. The content service downloads the just uploaded stream from the content storage and compares the hash once again with the expected value (Upload content). _arveo stores the hash value in a system property and persists the value in the document type metadata table. In case of very sensible data you can enable transparent encryption to follow the data protection rules and prevent your administrators from access of document content. For the supported databases PostgreSQL 17.0 you can select between different data replication strategies: Asynchronous replication (backup or mirror): Enables an asynchronous disaster recovery. Your database is periodically mirrored. Synchronous database cluster: Transactions are synchronously replicated on more than one master node. The provider of the PostgreSQL 17.0 cluster must guarantee that data is stored redundant and reduce potential data loss. The system operator is responsible for data security and recovery. He must ensure that the backups of the data are checked regularly and that recovery is reliably possible in the event of a failure. The IT processes that ensure the secure, redundant and highly available storage of arveo data in databases and object or file system storage systems are particularly decisive for the proper operation of the platform. These are the responsibility of the operator of the platform, who must implement the availability and security of the systems in accordance with legal and organizational requirements. We strongly recommend using a redundant file system or object storage system. If you do not at least backup your data periodically a data loss is likely. For high availability with almost zero data loss our storage system should replicate the written content and data synchronously. The operating team of the platform must ensure that an appropriate replication is set up and monitored. Object storages with REST APIs are designed for the cloud. If you decide to use storage from the Cloud (public or private) we recommend to use object storage via S3 API. Object storages provide a high level of redundancy (even geo redundant) and fail safety. The REST S3 API is very tolerant against network and infrastructure failures. Ensure technically and organizationally that there is sufficient space for storing the data. For the best high availability the provider of your storage system must protect the stored data against accidental, malicious, or disaster-induced loss of data. The better your data replication the better is your availability in case of a failure. To achieve high availability for arveo the provider must guarantee that all required (content services) run as a cluster. The provider of the arveo services should ensure that only authorized data protection officers & administrators have data write (INSERT,UPDATE, DELETE) permissions for the database and the content repository. An administrator only can illegally manipulate content if he can access both database and content storage because the control hash value of the content is stored in the database. Take care that none of your administrators has exclusive and unattended access to the content storage and the database. Distributed management roles of the storage systems and the arveo transparent encryption feature make your system more forgery-proof! The activities of administrators with extensive rights must be logged by the operator. The logs are subject to the retention periods of tax law and must be checked regularly. To prevent unauthorized access to the arveo platform the provider must: ensure that HTTPS communication is enabled for all clients, applications, 3rd party components and services (Services). enable OAuth2.0 or X.509 certificate authentication X.509 certificate authentication and authorization for all _arveo service (OAuth2.0). All _arveo services require authentication, ensuring that only arveo services or authenticated and authorized users can use the API. We recommend using a state-of-the-art authentication services like Keycloak with Single Sign-on and 2-factor authentication enabled. take suitable technical or organizational actions against unauthorized changes to the data such as firewall, VPN, transparent encryption with arveo or at hardware level, provide adequate protection of passwords by using a state-of-the-art IDP such as Keycloak or MS Active Directory and increasing the password complexity accordingly. take actions against denial of service attacks. The administrators of the arveo platform must: make sure that only authorized persons receive an account that grants access to arveo documents; ensure that objects are protected against unauthorized access using attribute based access control. We recommend defining access control either using type level restrictions or security attributes. the activities of managers who can change security attributes are logged via arveo audit and versioning. Both may be checked at regular intervals. organizationally ensure that the password the arveo administration users are changed regularly.","title":"Compliance recommendations (GoBD)","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"gobd","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-general/gobd.html","titles":[{"text":"Indexing and retrievel","hash":"indexing_and_retrievel","id":1},{"text":"Retention periods","hash":"retention_periods","id":2},{"text":"Audit log","hash":"audit_log","id":3},{"text":"Download and migration","hash":"download_and_migration","id":4},{"text":"Legally compliant migration","hash":"legally_compliant_migration","id":5},{"text":"Data integrity","hash":"data_integrity","id":6},{"text":"Content storage","hash":"content_storage","id":7},{"text":"Databases","hash":"databases","id":8},{"text":"Fail safety","hash":"_fail_safety","id":9},{"text":"Security","hash":"security","id":10},{"text":"Operators","hash":"operators","id":11},{"text":"Platform","hash":"_platform_link","id":12},{"text":"arveo Content Services","hash":"arveo_content_services","id":13}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"arveo expands your digital company platform and your public cloud or data center solutions with cloud-based enterprise content management (ECM). arveo is a multi-client and 100% cloud-ready content services platform. With arveo you can legally secure (GoBD certified) and DSGVO/GDPR-compliant manage the entire life cycle of your documents and files and process all your content. arveo ensures data and legal security even when using cloud storage services and takes into account the requirements of the GDPR and DSGVO with regard to the secure deletion of data.

Connect our lightweight arveo content services with a single, lean API with your system landscape, other open systems and the most suitable services for you from the cloud or on-premises. With this Best-Of-Breed approach, you can easily realize your company’s dream of a “single source of truth” across all systems. Figure 1. Our Vision: single source of information The arveo content services manage the entire life cycle of your content like Documents Images Videos Audio Text. arveo allows the free configuration of the content objects including metadata and mapping of folder hierarchies and electronic files. The market for \"headless systems\" has been growing for some time. These offer backend functions without a user interface of the system completely can be used by the end user. This is best known from content management systems (CMS) used in web development. With the increasing use of different end devices such as smartphones, tablets or wearables, they are increasing also the requirements for content management systems. In addition, users have a lot of content on different channels. Headless CMS dispense with the front end and thus enable your content to be displayed various channels through a single REST API. So if products are to be fully and seamlessly integrated in a platform and a dependency on a user interface or client is no longer desired, one speaks of so-called \"headless systems\". The wide availability of different cloud services and solutions enables the set up a modern platform for your business processes. Instead of relying on a monolithic ECM as before, companies combine the most suitable cloud content services and create with the \"best-of-breed\" Approach targeted added value for your digital company platforms. Regardless of whether you have your own solution, an open cloud application or your company portal, want to add secure and legally compliant ECM functions: You can access all of your data directly via a single interface (REST API), Access documents and information. arveo is headless by design. All modules are hosted as pure backend cloud services from Eitco or optionally hybrid in your private cloud or on-premises in your data center disposal. Of course, these are natively suitable for mobile applications. The stateless REST API is our product and is used by all arveo components and user interfaces. The web services are stable over the long term and are fully available to every customer. It is important to us that our services have open interfaces and can be easily integrated into an enterprise service infrastructure. As a modern content services platform, the arveo uses standards wherever possible in order to use the steadily growing number of cloud-enabled services inside or outside the company infrastructure. Whether operating system, database, text recognition, machine learning or object storage, arveo can access services from different manufacturers and combine them with its own services in order to quickly create added value. There are many ECM products and the market is constantly changing. A manufacturer-independent ECM standard such as SQL for relational databases has not fully established itself for ECM applications despite several attempts from WebDAV to JSR 170 to CMIS. The market is dominated by monolithic packages that master all ECM applications. A customer who implements a complex ECM application for his company often becomes highly dependent on a manufacturer and is faced with costs that are difficult to calculate when changing providers. Due to the availability of platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, which make a wide variety of services easily usable via web services, we are seeing a change in the behavior of companies who want to buy fewer complete solutions and instead are looking for specialized services that can easily be combined and thus create targeted added value for the digital company platform. Companies choose the best features from different manufacturers and combine them to create their own solutions, whereby you control the services used via your own API management or API gateways. This creates company platforms that not only access one, but often several repositories. Figure 2. Best-Of-Breed strategy This often called Best-Of-Breed strategy benefits from the fact that the services available in the marketplaces have become increasingly standardized in recent years. arveo consistently relies on a microservice architecture. The individual services are loosely connected to one another via lightweight stateless web service interfaces (http, REST) and each service can run and scale independently. All arveo functions are available via a uniform REST API gateway, which also takes care of the intelligent load distribution and the detection of defective services. Modern cloud-ready platforms rely on horizontal scaling and the load is distributed over many nodes, which can consist of inexpensive commodity hardware. Such a structure can also save costs through automated SCALE OUT and DOWN by switching nodes on or off as required. The arveo platform has a high tolerance for the failure of individual nodes. A high-performance availability is also required, since the end user nowadays only shows a limited understanding of long response times and can quickly switch to the competition in case of doubt. All arveo services support containerized deployment and use stateless REST APIs so that they can be easily integrated into any cloud infrastructure. Through the use of containerized applications (Docker) and the service management of the open source Spring Framework, which well-known providers such as Netflix use and continuously improve, the services can be installed automatically as often as required and thus scale out and down if you use the cloud orchestration framework kubernetes. You can cluster together linux containers and build an auto-scaling and high available platform with high fail safety. A blue-green deployment for the risk-free, downtime-free rollout of new software versions is also possible. Our services use standards as far as possible, so that services from different providers can be delivered without great integration effort and the customer can react quickly to changes in the market. Due to the secure web service interfaces, all services including the database can be obtained from the cloud at any time. With arveo services, you can build a sustained system architecture. By design arveo will you allow to separate your business logic from arveo ECM standard services and all other available cloud services like OCR, AI, document conversion (e.g. to PDF), identity management. arveo solutions are designed to be manufacturer-independent, so that the underlying REST ECM and other services can be exchanged at easily calculable costs. This approach makes it possible to exchange individual services through to the content services of arveo with little and easily calculable effort. Even arveo ECM services can be replaced by comparable services and via an open source S3 connector supplied, third-party systems can access the content objects migration-free using the S3 standard API. arveo is a native cloud platform and is based on Open Source libraries and services. Through the consistent microservice architecture and the use of open source cloud technology, you can keep arveo's operating costs low. Advantages of arveo operation All services are horizontally scalable separately and can therefore also be operated on simple hardware. arveo runs on all Linux and Windows operating systems. No additional license costs due to the consistent use of open source technology such as Linux, PostgreSQL 17.0. Container deployment: Simple integration into existing cloud platforms enables load-dependent, automated service provision up to blue-green deployment for seamless updates to new software versions. Hybrid architecture: Flexible use of cloud services or on-premise services. Low manufacturer dependency: By separating the user interface and business logic from the ECM / BPM services while using standards such as REST, S3 or BPMN2, there is less dependency on one manufacturer. Web applications: We deliver templates for PWA (Progressive Web Apps) based on the state-of-the-art angular framework, which are completely open source. I.e. their surfaces belong to you and can be used independently of arveo. Use of standards: Low training costs and high availability of know-how on the market through the use of standard frameworks (angular), standard interfaces (REST, S3, SAP Archive Link) and SDKs for Javascript, JAVA, C #. In addition, you can also use our ready-made, modern, clear, responsive and functional micro frontends, to make the arveo content services and thus their content easily available at the right time and in the right place in your business processes.

Our chose tech stack enables the implementation of both small projects, which only consist of a single component in the backend, and large projects with various distributed components. The created components are deployable both locally on the customer’s hardware and in a cloud environment. So the stack consists of the following components: Spring Framework The implementation of the backend components has been done in Java and Kotlin. The Spring Framework is used as the basis. Spring is an Open Source (Apache License) framework that has existed since 2004 with a large and very active developer community. The framework has a modular structure, which is why it is suitable for both simple and complex applications. It provides dependency injection, externalized configuration, and assistance with things like database access, transactions, messaging, etc. Spring MVC, WebFlux Spring MVC is a framework for creating web applications, especially for REST services. It is based on the servlet stack, in which a request is processed in a dedicated thread. WebFlux is also a framework for web applications, but is based on the reactive stack, in which the processing of a request is not restricted to one thread. Spring Security Spring Security is a component that provides authentication and authorization functionality. It can be used to secure web applications and also offers support for SSO technologies such as OAuth and SAML. Spring Cloud Spring Cloud is a collection of additional Spring components that provide the typical functionality required in a distributed or cloud application. The individual components can be used independently of one another and partly consist of integrable dependencies as well as independent applications. Which of the Spring Cloud components are used therefore depends entirely on the project requirements. Spring Cloud applications can be operated in managed cloud environments such as Cloud Foundry. Spring Cloud Config Spring Cloud Config offers a central configuration service as well as a client library for components that consume the configuration. In a Spring Boot application, it is sufficient to add the corresponding dependency. From then on, Spring will automatically read from the configuration service if it is available. The configuration data can be stored in simple files, in a database, a Git repository or in a protected repository such as Vault. In a distributed application with several components running on different machines, Spring Cloud Config can be used to implement central management for the configuration of all components. Spring Cloud Bus Spring Cloud Bus provides a bus for communication between the components or for connecting external components. The communication is based on the AMQP protocol and requires a backend such as RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ. With the help of the bus, e.g. Notify components when their configuration in the configuration service has changed. Eureka Eureka is a Spring Cloud component provided by Netflix that provides a service registry. A service registry is a central directory of all service instances. A service or a client application therefore only needs to know the URL of the service registry in order to access one of the other services. Eureka is an independently executable component and offers a client library for access to the registry. Hystrix Hystrix is a Spring Cloud component provided by Netflix that can be imagined as a fuse in an electrical installation. If one component of a cloud environment fails, Hystrix can isolate it from the other components to prevent further failures. Another instance of the component can then provide the functionality. Zuul Zuul is a Spring Cloud component provided by Netflix that provides an API gateway. An API gateway acts like a reverse proxy and hides the individual microservices from a client application. The client application only knows the API gateway and does not have to worry about the URLs of the various services. Ribbon Ribbon is a Spring Cloud component provided by Netflix that provides a client-side load balancer. Archetypes There are Maven archetypes that can be used to easily start a new project based on our technology stack. Different archetypes are available for different types of applications. The generated projects contain a Jenkins file with a preconfigured CI environment including static code analysis with sonar, OWASP dependency checks, load tests based on JMeter, a release mechanism at the push of a button and an optional teams hook. Also included are packaging modules with which the application can be packaged as a Linux daemon or as a Windows service and IDE configuration files for IntelliJ and Eclipse. Logging In order not to depend on a specific logging implementation, logging has been implemented with a logging facade SLF4J or to be exact, with its specific implementation logback. In contrast to Log4J, Logback is actively maintained and is less complicated during initialization. It can be combined with SLF4J. Logback is one of the standard Spring dependencies. Caching Caching frameworks are available in many variants that cover very different use cases. Frameworks are listed here sorted according to their primary use case. Local in-memory cache Caffeine has proven itself as a fast local in-memory cache. It can be combined with Spring’s caching abstraction layer. JDBC connection pool HikariCP has proven itself for JDBC connection pooling. This pool is also Spring’s standard dependency.","title":"Opensource Technology Stack","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"technology-stack","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-general/technology-stack.html","titles":[]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"The REST API has the following user-rights (authorities) for different endpoints: ECR_ADMIN: Allows editing type- and attribute definitions as well as other administrative operations.

In some cases it might be required to perform more complex schema changes, which cannot be handled by the system automatically. The following changes cannot be performed automatically on tables that already contains data: setting NOT NULL for an existing column; type changes especially to non-string columns; foreign keys; making a column UNIQUE. For example, changing the data type of an attribute is not supported because it usually requires project specific migration steps. Advanced changes like this can be performed by custom liquibase scripts. To perform custom database schema migrations, arveo offers several ways to define custom liquibase migration scripts: A global script that will be executed before the first type definition will be created or updated. This script can be configured using the property ecr.server.liquibase.preInitializationChangeLog. A global script that will be executed after the last type definition was created or updated. This script can be configured using the property ecr.server.liquibase.customChangeLog. A script for a specific type definition that will be executed before the type definition is created or updated. This script can be configured using the annotation @PreSchemaInitialization on the class representing the type definition. A script for a specific type definition that will be executed after the type definition was created or updated. This script can be configured using the annotation @PostSchemaInitialization on the class representing the type definition. The values of the configuration properties for the global scripts and the annotations must be valid URIs pointing to a liquibase changelog script. The URIs can point to a filesystem resource (using file:/) or a classpath resource (using classpath:). For a better understanding of how the schema initialization works, the following list shows the steps performed by the system at startup: Create or update the system tables Execute custom pre initialization changelog if configured For each registered type definition class: Execute custom class-specific pre schema initialization script if configured Create or update the type definition table(s) Execute custom class-specific post schema initialization script if configured Execute custom liquibase changelog if configured Note that the actions performed by the automatic schema initialization in step 3.b. can be influenced by the changes that were already performed by the custom scripts executed before. For example, the system will not try to create a new attribute if the custom script has already performed the required schema changes. The following example shows a type definition class that defines a custom script that will be executed before the type definition is updated. The script expects that the type definition table already exists on the database and is used to change the data type of the attribute postal_code from Long to String. Note that for the sake of simplicity, the script does not perform an actual data migration but simply drops and re-creates the database column for the attribute. Example for a type definition with custom pre schema initialization script @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) @Index(value = \"my_container_name_index\", onVersionTable = true) @PreSchemaInitialization(\"classpath:liquibase/my-container-changelog.xml\") @Variables public interface MyContainer { Example for a custom liquibase script <?xml version=\"1.1\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <databaseChangeLog xmlns=\"http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.1.xsd\" logicalFilePath=\"my-container-changelog.xml\"> <changeSet id=\"update-my-container-1\" author=\"root\"> <dropColumn tableName=\"my_container\" columnName=\"postal_code\"/> <addColumn tableName=\"my_container\"> <column name=\"postal_code\" type=\"text\"/> </addColumn> <dropColumn tableName=\"my_container_ver\" columnName=\"postal_code\"/> <addColumn tableName=\"my_container_ver\"> <column name=\"postal_code\" type=\"text\"/> </addColumn> </changeSet> </databaseChangeLog> Note that the script in the above example first updates the content of the type definition system tables to reflect the changed data type of the attribute postal_code of the type my_container. Doing this causes the automatic migration performed afterwards to ignore the change. Other changes in the type class would still be performed automatically, if possible. The script then simple drops and re-creates the column for the attribute. In a real-life scenario, this is the place where the actual data migration would happen. The following changes in the type system will not be checked for: Inheritance: Changing the source key or the source property of an inherited property is allowed. The system will accept it (and not even check it). This can have subtle consequences. The data of an entity created before such a change will still be as before. However, the next time it is updated the inheritance will be computed anew and thus the data will change according the new inheritance rule. formatted counter sequence names: Changing the name of the sequence of a formatted counter will take effect. This can have an impact on your application. It will result in the creation of a new sequence and effectively reset the counters value. This might be desired effect - it could also be the result of an oversight in the type changes. To protect oneself from accidental changes it is deemed could practice to mark formatted counter fields with @Unique. indexes prefixed with ecr_mnl_: Indexes defined on tables belonging to ecr types will be created and deleted according to changes in the types. However, indexes whose names start with the prefix ecr_mnl_ will be excluded from that. This enables admins to quickly react on slow systems without a system update inferring with such a patch. This has two consequences Admins, that manually add an index, should pick a name for the index that starts with ecr_mnl_ Developers, that add an index to an arveo type should pick a name that does not start with ecr_mnl_ In a case where an index prefixed with ecr_mnl_ is used it will be beneficially in the long-run, to add the index to the type. In this case the prefix ecr_mnl_ in the name must be omitted when defining the index on the type.","title":"Advanced db schema changes","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"advanced-schema-changes","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/advanced-schema-changes.html","titles":[{"text":"Schema initialization steps","hash":"schema_initialization_steps","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"example","id":2},{"text":"Changes not checked during startup","hash":"changes_not_checked_during_startup","id":3}]},"31":{"id":31,"text":"arveo allows entity access based on attributes of that entity. This can be specified per entity by a static method annotated with @Security. The method must return an eql expression that resolves to a boolean i.e. a condition. It will be called by arveo when entities of the given type are accessed to retrieve an additional filter for the access. Operations will only affect entities where the condition evaluates to true. Every operation on entities of the type will execute the method and add the resulting expression to the filter of the operation: Searches will add the expression to the filter of the search request. Batch operations will add the expression to their filter Calls that operate on a specific id will fail if the expression yields false. The simplest case would look like this: The simplest access check @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface UnsecuredDocuments { @Security static Expression<Boolean> calculateAccess() { return Eql.alwaysTrue(); } } This would add the filter 'true' to every operation on the entity, which would allow anyone to access entities. In most cases, one would want to compare attributes of the entity with properties of the user requesting the current operation. The first can be accomplished with the eql: Accessing an attribute @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface ThresholdContainer { int getThreshold(); void setThreshold(int threshold); @Security static Expression<Boolean> calculateAccess(Alias alias) { return EcrQueryLanguage.condition(). alias(alias).field(\"threshold\"). greaterThan().value(300); } } Users may only access entities of the type above where the field 'threshold' is greater than 300. In order to check the user requesting an operation, one can define a parameter to the method of the type de.eitco.ecr.common.search.AuthenticationContext. Other information may be accessed this way, too. The method can have up to four parameters of the following types: de.eitco.ecr.common.search.AuthenticationContext: this class holds information about the user requesting the operation. de.eitco.ecr.common.AccessRight: the right needed to perform the operation. de.eitco.ecr.common.search.Alias: identifies the part of the query that holds the entity org.jooq.DSLContext: an entrypoint to the jooq api bound to the database and schema the table containing the entities is located in. The AuthenticationContext holds information about the user requesting the operation. This parameter will most likely be used in every such method, except for the most basic cases. Take a case where access to a document is specified by a field named access_token. It holds the name of a user-management authority every user with access to it must have. If it is null, every user has access to the document: A type specifying different access to different users @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @OverwriteAllowed public interface DocumentWithAccessToken { @Mandatory(false) String getAccessToken(); (1) void setAccessToken(String accessToken); @Security static Expression<Boolean> calculateAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext, DSLContext dslContext) { (4) return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() .alias(alias).field(\"access_token\").isNull() (2) .or() .value(authenticationContext.getAuthoritiesAsStrings()) .contains().alias(alias).field(\"access_token\") .holds(); } // ... // more attributes (3) } 1 the type defines the attribute that specifies access 2 the query generated uses this attribute. 3 other elements of the type are omitted for the sake of readability 4 note that the third parameter is unused. In such a case it could be omitted. The AuthenticationContext provides access to the CommonAuthentication and the ExternalCommonUserDetails stored in the security context of the current user. The CommonAuthentication contains the user’s IDs (internal and external). The ExternalCommonUserDetails contain common and generic attributes that were read from the user’s access token and/or from the OpenID Connect user info endpoint. All of this information can be used to decide whether the user is allowed to perform a specific action or not. In the next example the email of a user is used in an ABAC security method. using a user’s email address in ABAC @Mandatory String getEmail(); void setEmail(String email); @Security static Expression<Boolean> checkAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { ExternalCommonUserDetails details = authenticationContext.getCommonUserDetails(); return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() .alias(alias).field(\"email\") .equalTo().value(details.getEmail()) .holds(); } The AccessRight parameter holds the right necessary to perform the operation requested. This is a hint for the method about what should actually be done in the operation. It allows differentiating between read and write access: A type differentiating between read and write access @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) @OverwriteAllowed public interface ContainerAccessedByUserId { long getOwner(); (1) void setOwner(long owner); List<Long> getAudience(); (2) void setAudience(List<Long> audience); @Security static Expression<Boolean> checkAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext, AccessRight right) { long userId = authenticationContext.getAuthentication().getInternalIdOrFail(); if (AccessRight.READ.getValue() < right.getValue()) { (3) return EcrQueryLanguage.condition().alias(alias).field(\"owner\").equalTo().value(userId).holds(); } return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() (4) .alias(alias).field(\"audience\").contains().value(userId) .or().alias(alias).field(\"owner\").equalTo().value(userId) .holds(); } // ... // more attributes } 1 This type defines an attribute owner holding the user id of the user, responsible. The owner of an entity will be the only user to modify the entities. 2 The type also defines a list of user ids audience, holding the ids of users that may read the entity. Users that are neither owner nor audience have no access on the entity. 3 Thus, in cases where a right greater than READ is requested, the method returns an expression, that checks whether the current user is the owner of the document. 4 In every other case .i.e. the requested access right is READ or below, an expression is returned, that checks whether the current user is the owner or part of the audience. The alias identifies the part of the query executed that contains the entity and should be used to reference its members. Always use the alias as given in the examples. Other ways to reference the entity might work in most cases but only using the alias assures that referencing entity attributes works in every case. The full class name is de.eitco.ecr.common.search.Alias. Avoid confusion with another Alias class. In some cases, using expressions on the entity itself may become cumbersome or slow. For that, one can use the DSLContext parameter. This allows access by jooq to any table in the same schema the table of the requested entity is located in. It can be used to obtain specific data directly. Since the access is directly to the database, there are no further access checks on queries using DSLContext. Depending on the operation requested, the method may be able to execute INSERT or UPDATE statements. It is the responsibility of the security methods author to make sure changes do not create an inconsistent or otherwise corrupted state of the database. The simplest way to assure this, is to use the DSLContext only to read data. Sometimes it might be required to distinguish between a user changing the value of an attribute used for the attribute based access control and a user changing some other attribute of an entity. For example, the security requirements might make it necessary that only one specific user is allowed to change security-relevant attributes, but other users are allowed to change other attributes. To meet such requirements, attributes used in ABAC can be annotated with @SecurityProperty. Changing the value of such a property requires the highest access right CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS. If such an operation occurs, the ABAC method will be called with the value CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS for the AccessRight parameter. Security properties can be defined as exclusive or basic. Exclusive security properties cannot be changed in an operation that would change any other property of the entity. This can be used to ensure that a user, who is designated to manage entity security cannot perform any other kind of change on the entities. The following example shows a type definition that uses a list of user IDs to decide whether a user is allowed to access an entity or not. To keep the example simple, no distinction is made betweed read- and write-access. Changing the value of the security attribute however is only allowed if the user was given an authority called CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS. security properties @SecurityProperty(exclusive = true) @Optional List<Long> getAuthorizedUsers(); (1) void setAuthorizedUsers(List<Long> authorizedUsers); @Security static Expression<Boolean> checkAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext, AccessRight right) { if (right == AccessRight.CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS) { Set<String> authorities = authenticationContext.getAuthoritiesAsStrings(); return EcrQueryLanguage.condition().value(right.name()).in().values(authorities).holds(); (2) } long userId = authenticationContext.getAuthentication().getInternalIdOrFail(); return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() .alias(alias).field(\"authorized_users\").isNull().or() .alias(alias).field(\"authorized_users\").contains().value(userId).holds(); (3) } 1 Changing this attribute requires the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS right 2 Only a user with an authority called CHANGED_ACCESS_RIGHTS is allowed to perform this operation 3 Everything else is allowed, when the user’s ID is contained in the list of authorized users It is possible to annotate an inherited attribute with @SecurityProperty, but there is one important difference compared to non-inherited attributes. The inheritance is triggered as an update one the foreign key attribute that is used to reference the entity the value is inherited from. This means that such an operation requires the WRITE access right, not the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS right. The actual update of the value is performed on the database level, where the check for the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS right will occur. For the inheritance to work, the user performing the operation needs both WRITE and CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS privileges on the entity. Of course, it is possible to annotate the foreign key attribute with @SecurityProperty, too. This would impose a stricter access requirement, making it impossible to change any inherited attribute for users without the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS right. security attribute inheritance @ForeignKey(target = LabeledContainer.class, targetProperty = \"id\") Long getContainerId(); (1) void setContainerId(Long value); @SecurityProperty(exclusive = true) @InheritedProperty(foreignKeyPropertyName = \"container_id\", sourcePropertyName = \"label\") String getSecurityLabel(); (2) @Security static Expression<Boolean> checkAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext, AccessRight right) { if (right == AccessRight.CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS) { (3) Set<String> authorities = authenticationContext.getAuthoritiesAsStrings(); return EcrQueryLanguage.condition().value(right.name()).in().values(authorities).holds(); } Set<String> authorities = authenticationContext.getAuthoritiesAsStrings(); return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() (4) .alias(alias).field(\"security_label\").equalTo().value(\"admins\") .and().value(authorities).contains().value(\"ECR_ADMIN\") (5) .or() .alias(alias).field(\"security_label\").equalTo().value(\"auditors\") .and().value(authorities).contains().value(\"AUDITOR\").holds(); (6) } 1 The foreign key that references the entity to inherit the value for the security_label attribute from 2 The inherited security attribute 3 The condition for operations requiring CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS 4 The condition for operations requiring all other rights including WRITE, which is required for inheritance 5 In this case, the user would require the ECR_ADMIN and the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS authority to successfully change the inherited security property 6 In this case, the user would require the AUDITOR and the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS authority to successfully change the inherited security property There might be cases where the attribute defining access is not part of the entity itself, but part of another entity referred to by a foreign key or a relation. In such cases a subselect comes handy. Assume two entity types: documents, to which access is restricted by an attribute named owner_group which is part of the second entity a container. An owner group must be given Documents are linked to their container with a foreign key named contained_in: The container entity @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface OwnedContainer { String getOwnerGroup(); (1) void setOwnerGroup(String ownerGroup); // ... // more attributes } The document entity @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface OwnedDocument { @ForeignKey(target = OwnedContainer.class, targetProperty = \"id\") ContainerId getContainedIn(); (2) void setContainedIn(ContainerId container); @Security static Expression<Boolean> calculateAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { Collection<String> groupIds = authenticationContext.getCommonUserDetails().getCollectionAttribute(\"group-memberships\", String.class, List.of()); (3) return EcrQueryLanguage.condition().alias(alias).field(\"contained_in\").in() (4) .select(\"id\").from(\"owned_container\").as(\"container\").where(). contextReference(\"container\", \"owner_group\").in().values(groupIds).holds().holds(); } // ... // more attributes } 1 The entity OwnedContainer holds the attribute that specifies access. 2 The entity OwnedDocument is linked with a container by its attribute contained_in. 3 The AuthenticationContext is used to obtain the names of every group the current user is a member of. The group-memberships attribute was added to the user info response by the authentication service and loaded by the repository service using OpenId Connect. 4 The group ids are used to create a check whether the entity is contained in a container whose owner_group is one of the users groups. Since attribute based security - by definition - is based on attributes, it must be able to be specified by type. However, in some cases a more general solution is desired. In these cases, java interface inheritance comes handy. Assume the class DocumentWithAccessToken from above. Assume further that there are other types (ContainerWithAccessToken and FolderWithAccessToken) that should be secured by their access-token as well. In this case it is a good practice to combine the access method and field in a common superinterface: Superinterface (2) public interface WithAccessToken { @SecurityProperty @Mandatory(false) String getAccessToken(); void setAccessToken(String accessToken); @Security static Expression<Boolean> calculateAccess(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() (1) .alias(alias).field(\"access_token\").isNull() .or() .alias(alias).field(\"access_token\").in() .values(authenticationContext.getAuthoritiesAsStrings()) .holds(); } } 1 The check for the access token is defined here. 2 note that this interface does not specify an entity by itself, since it lacks a @Type annotation. Then the types itself can simply inherit this feature: Inheriting entity 1 @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) @OverwriteAllowed public interface ContainerWithAccessToken extends WithAccessToken { } Inheriting entity 2 @Type(ObjectType.FOLDER) @OverwriteAllowed public interface FolderWithAccessToken extends WithAccessToken { } Here we take a look at a more complex example: a Hospital. The hospital manages documents concerning cases. A case belongs to a patient. Users of the system are hospital employees and may access data about documents, cases and patients. These users are part of one or several wards. For every ward there is a group in the system containing the users that are part of this ward. Cases have a list of wards - that may change over time - where the patient was treated for that case. Access is specified as follows; A user may only access cases whose wards contain at least one ward, the user is a member of. A user may only access patients whose cases he may access. A user may only access document whose cases he may access. Cases could be modeled as follows: The case @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface MedicalRecordCase { @Mandatory @ForeignKey(target = MedicalRecordPatient.class, targetProperty = \"id\") ContainerId getPatient(); (1) void setPatient(ContainerId containerId); @Mandatory List<String> getWards(); (2) void setWards(List<String> wards); @Security static Expression<Boolean> access(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { Collection<String> groupNames = authenticationContext.getCommonUserDetails() .getCollectionAttribute(\"group-memberships\", String.class, List.of()); (3) Expression<Boolean> result = null; for (String groupName : groupNames) { (4) Expression<Boolean> wardCondition = EcrQueryLanguage.condition() (5) .alias(alias).field(\"wards\").contains().value(groupName) .holds(); if (result == null) { result = wardCondition; } else { result = Eql.or(result, wardCondition); (6) } } if (result == null) { return Eql.alwaysFalse(); (7) } return result; } // case attributes ... (8) } 1 A case holds a foreign key to a patient. Since a case must have a patient, this attribute is mandatory. 2 A case has a list of wards, where it was treated. This attribute is also mandatory. 3 When computing access, the groups - and thus the wards - of the current user are obtained from the AuthenticationContext. The group-memberships attribute was added to the user info response by the authentication service and loaded by the repository service using OpenId Connect. 4 Since it is necessary to check whether the intersection between the wards of the case and the groups of the user is not empty, it is iterated over all the groups of the user. 5 A condition is created that checks whether the entities wards contain the current group. 6 Access is granted when one of the conditions created yields true. 7 If the user is in no group whatsoever he may access no case at all. 8 Further attributes are omitted for the sake of readability. Now Patients specify their security as follows: The patient @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface MedicalRecordPatient { @Security static Expression<Boolean> access(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { Alias caseAlias = Alias.byName(\"case\"); (2) Expression<Boolean> caseAccessCondition = MedicalRecordCase.access(caseAlias, authenticationContext); (1) return EcrQueryLanguage.condition().exists() .select(\"id\").from(MedicalRecordCase.class).as(caseAlias.getValue()) (3) .where() .alias(caseAlias).field(\"patient\").equalTo().alias(alias).id() (4) .and(caseAccessCondition).holds().holds(); (5) } // patient attributes ... } 1 Access to a patient depends on access to cases. So, the MedicalRecordCase.access() is called (see above). 2 In order to do that a custom alias is specified, that is used for the method call and in the query below. 3 Using a subselect its is checked whether there is a case …​ 4 …​ that is assigned to the patient the access is checked for and …​ 5 …​ and to which the current user may access. Documents may specify their security method very similar, only the document-to-case link is specified the other way around: The document @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface MedicalRecordDocument { @ForeignKey(target = MedicalRecordCase.class, targetProperty = \"id\") @Mandatory ContainerId getCase(); (1) void setCase(ContainerId containerId); @Security static Expression<Boolean> access(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { Alias caseAlias = Alias.byName(\"case\"); Expression<Boolean> caseAccessCondition = MedicalRecordCase.access(caseAlias, authenticationContext); (2) return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() .exists().select(\"id\").from(MedicalRecordCase.class).as(caseAlias.getValue()) .where() .alias(caseAlias).id().equalTo().alias(alias).field(\"case\") (3) .and(caseAccessCondition).holds().holds(); } // patient attributes ... } 1 A document is assigned to a case. This is mandatory. 2 As for patients, the access check for documents depends on the access check for cases. 3 A similar subselect to the one above is created, however here the outer select holds the link to the inner one. In the example above access to the entities is defined by one attribute: the wards of a case. It is assumed that a case may be treated in several wards - one after another - and every employee belonging to those wards needs access to the case, its patients data and its documents. Visiting the wards one after another will result in several updates on the case - each adding another ward - and thus in a revision history where the list of wards will build up over time. This has an interesting consequence in the scenario above : The access to older versions of the case will be granted to users who were allowed to access it at the time the version was created. For instance, if a case started in the pulmonology it would have the following revision list: revision ward(s) 1 pulmonology If it was moved to intensive care after that, it would result in the following revision list: revision ward(s) 1 pulmonology 2 pulmonology, intensive care Employees working in intensive care would be unable to access data of revision 1 of this case. Depending on the scenario this might or might not be desired. If this is not desired, it can be fixed with a simple annotation on the case interface: An alternative case @Mandatory @Versioned(value = false) List<String> getWards(); By simply specifying the wards attribute as not versioned, changes on the attribute will affect every revision of the case. If a case started in the pulmonology it would at first have the same revision history as above: revision ward(s) 1 pulmonology However, if it was moved to intensive care now, the revision list would look like this: revision ward(s) 1 pulmonology, intensive care 2 pulmonology, intensive care Now all employees in pulmonology and intensive care have access to every revision of this case. This solution can be used generally. When access control to entities depends on attributes, deciding whether those attributes are versioned or not is an important detail. Assume that in the hospital from the example above, the information which employee belongs to which ward is kept in a separate table named 'employee_to_ward'. This table is managed by an external application. As stated earlier, it is possible to add a parameter of the type org.jooq.DSLContext to a security method in order to gain direct access to the database. This could be used to access the 'employee_to_ward' table: Using DSLContext @Security static Expression<Boolean> access( Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext, DSLContext context (1) ) { long userId = authenticationContext.getAuthentication().getInternalIdOrFail(); (2) final List<String> wards = context.selectFrom(\"test_employee_to_ward\") .where(DSL.field(DSL.name(\"employee\")).eq(DSL.value(userId))) (3) .fetch(DSL.field(\"ward\", String.class)); Expression<Boolean> result = null; for (String ward : wards) { // ... (as above) (4) 1 The DSLContext is defined as another parameter. 2 The AuthenticationContext is only used to get the current users id. 3 The wards of the user are obtained using the jooq-api to directly access the database. Depending on the scenario, it might improve performance to cache the result of this query. 4 After that, the same code as above is executed. Alternatively, an arveo custom @Type could be used to access the external table: An external type @View (1) @Name(\"employee_to_ward\") (2) @Type(ObjectType.META) public interface UserToWard { long getEmployee(); void setEmployee(long employee); String getWard(); void setWard(String ward); } 1 The @View annotation marks the type as external. This means arveo will not create the corresponding table. 2 The @Name annotation specifies the name of the table the types entities are stored in. Now, in the security method this type can be accessed with a subselect: Using subselect @Security static Expression<Boolean> access(Alias alias, AuthenticationContext authenticationContext) { final Alias userWard = Alias.byName(\"user_ward\"); (1) return EcrQueryLanguage.condition() .exists().select(\"ward\").from(UserToWard.class).as(userWard.getValue())(2) .where() .alias(userWard).field(\"employee\").equalTo() .value(authenticationContext.getAuthentication().getInternalIdOrFail()) (3) .and() .alias(alias).field(\"wards\").contains() (4) .alias(userWard).field(\"ward\").holds() .holds(); } 1 First, an alias is declared for the subselect. 2 Then, a query is created that checks whether there is a ward, that …​ 3 …​ the current user is assigned to and …​ 4 …​ that is contained in the current entities wards attribute.","title":"Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"attribute-based-security","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/attribute-based-security.html","titles":[{"text":"Parameters","hash":"parameters","id":1},{"text":"AuthenticationContext: who requests the operation?","hash":"authenticationcontext_who_requests_the_operation","id":2},{"text":"AccessRight: what will the operation do?","hash":"accessright_what_will_the_operation_do","id":3},{"text":"Alias","hash":"alias","id":4},{"text":"DSLContext","hash":"dslcontext","id":5},{"text":"Security properties","hash":"_abac_properties","id":6},{"text":"Security attributes and inheritance","hash":"security_attributes_and_inheritance","id":7},{"text":"Examples","hash":"examples","id":8},{"text":"Subselect","hash":"subselect","id":9},{"text":"Interface inheritance","hash":"interface_inheritance","id":10},{"text":"Complex scenario: a Hospital","hash":"complex_scenario_a_hospital","id":11},{"text":"Revision history and ABAC","hash":"revision_history_and_abac","id":12},{"text":"Accessing external tables","hash":"accessing_external_tables","id":13},{"text":"Using direct database access","hash":"using_direct_database_access","id":14},{"text":"Using a Metadata type","hash":"using_a_metadata_type","id":15}]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"The client SDKs provide APIs for applications using arveo.

List<Long> array(bigint) _arveo stores multiple bigint values in an array column of PostgreSQL 17.0. List data types allow you to store more than String or long value for a property. You can search for each value using the array search operation of the arveo query language. Enumeration data types allow you to set one or more values from a fixed set of values. By default, PostgreSQL 17.0 does not limit the length of String values. Typically, it is not necessary to define a length using the @Length annotation because PostgreSQL 17.0 does handle Strings of all length very well. Your strings should have a length up to 4 kByte. Even larger strings are allowed, but you should take care that you do not inadvertently consume too much data space if you store very large strings. By default, searches on String attributes are performed in a case-insensitive manner. Note that the actual values are stored case sensitively in the database, which means that a unique constraint will treat \"example\" as a different value then \"Example\". The case-insensitive searches are performed by converting the value stored in the database and the value to search for to lower-case in the SQL-query. This is done automatically by arveo. If searches are to be performed in a case-sensitive manner, add the @CaseSensitive annotation to the attribute. Because the way a query is performed is defined by the setting on the attribute, it is not possible to perform case-insensitive and case-sensitive queries on the same attribute except for like, ends-with and starts-with queries. Adding indexes to the database column has a huge impact on search performance, especially for large tables. This table gives an overview of the available indexes.

Default = false. See permissions on type definitions for details. @AttributeType This annotation sets the type of an attribute. When given, this overrides the return type of the annotated getter. In such a case a corresponding AttributeMapper must be registered. @ContentElement This annotation defines a content element for a type definition. A content element is named and contains one binary content. Note that this annotation can only be used for type definitions of type DOCUMENT. See content elements for details. @ContentType This annotation can be used to mark a getter as the source of the content element’s media type. This is especially useful when a content element is stored in a separate field and is not restricted to a specific type. The content type information is used internally for fulltext extraction and rendition creation. The annotated getter must return a string containing a valid mime type definition. This annotation is ignored when the referenced content element persists its content type in the database. @EcrIgnore This annotation marks a method to be ignored as property or a class to be ignored as a type. @Enumeration This annotation can be used to configure a registered enumeration type. An example can be found here. @FilingEnabled This annotation is used to enable or disable the filing feature of document type definitions. If it is enabled, documents can be associated to folders. @FormattedCounter This annotation marks an attribute of type String as a formatted counter. @OptimisticLocking This annotation enables the optimistic locking feature for a type definition. When optimistic locking is enabled, an entity can be updated only if the entity has not been updated since it was loaded by the updating client. @OverwriteAllowed This annotation enables the possibility to overwrite an existing version of an entity. @RelationCounter This annotation marks a field of type Int as a counter for a specific relation type. More details can be found here. @Rendition This annotation defines a special kind of ContentElement that contains a rendition of another content element. @RenditionCreationCondition This annotation marks a default method as a callback used to decide whether a rendition should be created. The methods' return type must be boolean. It may have up to two parameters of type RenditionInfo: The first one being the source type and the second one being the target type. If only one parameter is given it is assumed to be the source type. @Type This annotation marks a class to be a TypeDefinition used in a TypeDefinitionRegistration. Constraint annotations Annotation Description @AutoIncrement This annotation indicates that the value of an attribute will be auto-incremented by the database. Currently only attributes of type short, int and long support auto-incrementing. @Length This annotation specifies the length of a string or binary attribute. @Mandatory This annotation marks an attribute as mandatory. @Optional This annotation marks an attribute as optional as opposed to Mandatory. @Precision This annotation specifies the precision of a decimal data type. @PrimaryKey This annotation marks a custom property as part of the elements primary key. The primary key will be combined of every custom property annotated with this annotation and the system property id. The property will be mandatory. @ReadOnly This annotation marks an attribute as a read-only attribute. Read-only attributes have to be set to a non-null value when an entity is created and cannot be changed when the entity is updated. @SecondaryKey This annotation marks a property as secondary key i.e. it is mandatory and unique. @Unique This annotation marks an attribute as unique. Default value annotations Annotation Description @DefaultSystemPropertyValue This annotation marks a default method as default value supplier for a system property. @DefaultValue This annotation marks a default method as default value supplier for a property (either a property-like system property or a custom property). Index annotations Annotation Description @Index This annotation is used to configure properties of an index. The indexed columns have to be annotated with Indexed using the same index name. @Indexed This annotation defines that an index will be created for an attribute. When several attributes are annotated to use an index with the same name, a multi-column-index will be created for these columns. Use Index to configure additional properties of the index. @IndexedForTextMatching This annotation tells the system to create a special index for an attribute to speed up text matching operations. More specifically, a GIN index using trigram operators will be created. Such an index should be used to speed up text matching operations like 'LIKE', especially when the expressions use a leading wildcard. These indexes can only be used on String fields. More information can be found here. Naming annotations Annotation Description @EnumerationTypeName This annotation specifies the name of the enumeration-type of an attribute. Only used when the attribute is an enum type. If not set, the name of the enum type (in snake-case) will be used. @EnumerationValue This annotation con be used to configure an enumeration value. @Name This annotation specifies the name of an attribute, type definition, foreign key, index or partial view. @TableName This annotation specifies the table name of a type definition. Reference annotations Annotation Description @CascadeDelete This annotation enables cascading deletes on a property acting as a foreign key. This could be a system attribute or any custom attribute annotated with ForeignKey. Note that cascading delete is only supported for foreign keys in entities that do not support retention. @ForeignKey This annotation marks a custom property as a foreign key to the type definition the given class defines. The property must have the same type and name as the referenced type definition’s primary key (or one part of it should it be combined). If the referenced type definition’s primary key is combined the custom property’s type definition needs to define custom properties for every part of the referenced type definition’s primary key which need to have the same name. More information can be found here. @InheritedProperty This annotation marks a property as an inherited property. More information can be found here. @SourceType This annotation specifies the class being the source of a relation. @TargetType This annotation specifies the class being the target of a relation. For more information see Validation. Validation annotations Annotation Description @Validated Allows to define SpEL validation expressions. @ValidatedBy References a validation method. @ValidationMethod Marks a method as a validation method. System annotations Annotation Description @Audit This annotation enables auditing of create-, update- and delete-operations on the type definition. @CaseSensitive This annotation marks a field of type String as case-sensitive. This effects how searches on this field will be performed. The value itself will always be stored preserving the case. @Id This annotation is used to define a getter for the ID system property. @InputProperty This annotation marks a setter method to be setting a property that is part of an update or create call and not a member of the entity itself. Examples are revision commentary or the update counter. @PostSchemaInitialization This annotation defines a liquibase changelog that will be executed after the database schema for this type definition is created or updated. The value must be a valid URI pointing to a classpath resource or a file. Examples: classpath:liquibase/type-definition-changelog.xml or file:/C:/changelogs/type-definition-changelog.xml. @PreSchemaInitialization This annotation defines a liquibase changelog that will be executed before the database schema for this type definition is created or updated. The value must be a valid URI pointing to a classpath resource or a file. @RecycleBin This annotation enables the recycle bin feature on a type definition. @RetentionProtected This annotation marks a type to have retention protection applied. That means it will be equipped with additional system properties RETENTION_DATE and LITIGATION_HOLD and objects of objects will be prevented from being deleted according to the values of these properties. More information can be found here. @Security This annotation marks a static method as an evaluator for attribute based access control. @SecurityProperty Values of attributes annotated with this annotation can only be changed by users with the CHANGE_ACCESS_RIGHTS authority. @SkipAutomaticSchemaCreation This annotation declares that no automatic creation of the database schema should be done for the annotated type. This means that the application programmers themselves are responsible to create the database tables, constraints, etc. needed. @SystemProperty This annotation is used to define a getter for a system property. @TypeId This annotation manually specifies the id of the type annotated. Will be ignored on internal views since they potentially specify several types. @Variables This annotation enables variables for a type definition. Unlike attributes, variables are not stored in individual database columns, but in a JSONB column, making it possible to add variables without changing the database schema or the type interface. More information can be found here. @Versioned This annotation defines if an attribute of a type is versioned or not (when placed on a getter) or if all attributes of a type are versioned or not (when placed on a type). When the annotation is present on a type and on a getter in the type, the annotation on the getter wins. View annotations Annotation Description @PartialView This annotation marks a class to be a partial view of the type definition created by another class via the Type annotation. Partial views can be used for updates and select clauses. No type definitions will be created for classes annotated this way. @View This annotation specifies whether the defined type is a view i.e. whether the system should create the tables for it. Please note the following tips regarding Unique identifiers: To allow users and 3rd party applications to identify and find objects in arveo you should define a unique and immutable property. The property must be @Unique to ensure that an application can identify the item. Make the property @ReadOnly to ensure that the identifier is always set and immutable. Your business application or the user must set the value when the object is created. Use the @AutoIncrement annotation instead of @Unique and @Readonly if a simple sequential Long id meets your requirements. If you need a more sophisticated unique identifier you can use the annotation @FormattedCounter which allows you to create e.g. String identifiers like <year>-<sequence> (Example). If overwrite is turned on it is possible to manipulate the originally saved content and compromise the document without creating a versioned copy. Ensure that the @OverwriteAllowed annotation is not present on legally compliant document types. Example of a default value definition @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface ContainerWithSimpleDefaultProperty { String DEFAULT_STRING = \"default string\"; (2) @Mandatory String getMyStringField(); void setMyStringField(String myStringField); @DefaultValue(\"my_string_field\") (1) default String defaultStringField() { return DEFAULT_STRING; } // ... // your custom attribute definitions // ... } 1 With @DefaultValue(\"my_string_field\") the method defaultStringField is defined to return the default value of my_string_field.Note that the reference in the annotation is in snake-case while the actual property getMyStringField is camel-case. 2 In a simple case like this it is considered good practice to declare a constant default value as a public constant.However, the default method does not need to return a constant.For example, date-time fields could use ZonedDateTime.now() to specify the timestamp of the creation as default value. As an example of annotations usage let us define an interface BookIndex with two properties, page and chapter.These properties have to be indexed. Object annotation of type Meta @Type(ObjectType.META) @Index(\"book-chapter-page-index\") public interface BookIndex { @PrimaryKey @AutoIncrement int getId(); @Indexed(\"book-chapter-page-index\") int getChapter(); void setChapter(int chapter); @Indexed(\"book-chapter-page-index\") int getPage(); void setPage(int page); } The above-mentioned properties are thus marked with the annotation @Indexed, which ensures, that an index will be created for these attributes.Here, the annotation @Index on the type is an example of an annotation on a type, described above. Text matching operations, especially when using leading wildcards, usually cannot use regular database indexes which causes poor query performance. PostgreSQL provides a special kind of index using trigrams. Using a trigram bases index, a query using an expression like where column like '%value' will show a much better performance. To use trigram based indexes, the pg_trgm extension must be available in the installed PostgreSQL database. arveo can automatically create a trigram index (or, more specifically, a GIN index using trigram operators) on a string attribute when it is annotated with @IndexedForTextMatching. The EQL provides an endswith and a like expression. Both will be able to use the index. Using the @FormattedCounter annotation it is possible to define counters with prefix and suffix that are backed by a sequence on the database.There are several properties that can be defined in the annotation: Property Description prefix The prefix used for the counter values. Can contain placeholders. suffix The suffix used by the counter values. Can contain placeholders. digits The number of digits for the counter. Shorter numbers will be padded with zero. sequenceName The name of the sequence to use. Can contain placeholders. autoGenerateSequences The number of sequences to auto-generate when the system is started in maintenance mode. startValue The start value of the generated sequence(s). The parameters prefix, suffix and sequenceName support placeholders.Currently, the system supports a placeholder for dates in the form $date(<format>) where format is a java date format string supported by java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter#ofPattern(String) The autoGenerateSequences property can only be used when the sequenceName contains the placeholder $date(uuuu).It must not contain any other placeholders. The following example shows a formatted counter attribute used as an invoice number that will produce counter values in the form 2021#0103.It will be backed by a sequence called inv_no_seq_2021.The system will create the next 10 sequences automatically (inv_no_seq_2021 to inv_no_seq_2030).The start value of each sequence will be 100. The sequence to use will be determined automatically because of the date placeholder in the sequenceName property.So on January 1st 2022, the generated counter values will use another prefix and the counter will start over at 100 (2022#0100).Each time the system is started in maintenance mode, it will make sure that sequences for the next 10 years will be present. Example: Defining a formatted counter attribute @FormattedCounter(prefix = \"$date(uuuu)#\", digits = 4, sequenceName = \"inv_no_seq_$date(uuuu)\", autoGenerateNextSequences = 10, startValue = 100) String getInvoiceNumber(); Add the @CascadeDelete annotation to the getter for the foreign key attribute. For relation types it is possible to add the cascade delete option to the foreign keys to the parent and child of the relation.To do that, add a system property for the parent- and/or child-id and annotate it with @CascadeDelete. Usage of the annotation @CascadeDelete // simple foreign key @CascadeDelete @Mandatory(false) @ForeignKey(target = BookIndex.class, targetProperty = \"id\") Integer getReferencedIndex(); // parent- and child-id of a relation @CascadeDelete @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.PARENT_ID) short getParentId(); @CascadeDelete @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CHILD_ID) short getChildId(); The cascade delete option is supported only for entities that are not versioned (hence it cannot be used on Document types) and do not support retention or inheritance.It is also not possible to inherit attribute values from a type definition that has a foreign key with the cascade delete option. If a getter for a system field is defined, then it is possible to define a setter, if the system field is property like. The following fields are property-like: retention_date. To define your type as a view or a partial view, you have to annotate your type with @View or @PartialView.The @View annotation specifies whether the defined type is a view i.e. whether it should create the tables for it.The @PartialView annotation marks a class to be a partial view of the type definition created by another class via the @Type annotation.Partial views can be used for updates and selects with limited select clauses.No tables will be created for classes annotated this way.The interfaces that are to be defined as views of an object type, have to be registered on the interface, representing this object type.For instance, if an interface NamedFile inherits from the interface NamedEntity, and NamedEntity is a partial view of NamedFile, it has to be registered on the object from which it inherits: @PartialView(NamedFile.class) public interface NamedEntity { //... } Note: An interface may also be a partial view of more than one type definitions. It is possible to expose tables that are under control of other applications to arveo and include them in its type system.This assumes that the given tables are in the same database schema as the tables of arveo.Also, one needs to know the name of these tables as well as their types.In this case one can define a meta-type annotated with @View. External views will only be read from ecr.It will never write to an external view. To access system properties you can use the annotation @SystemProperty and pass one of the names defined in the SystemPropertyName enumeration. general system fields: ID: The unique identifier of the entity. Use on EcrId properties (or subclasses as applicable). Can be used on any entity CREATION_DATE: The date and time the relation was created. Use on ZonedDateTime properties. Can only be used on relations. CREATOR_USER_ID: The id of the user that created this relation. Use on UserId properties. Can only be used on relations.

The the storage period may be extended but never shortened. Can only be used on potentially versioned entities i.e. Folders, Documents, Relations and Containers that declared to be retention protected. LITIGATION_HOLD:A flag that indicates whether a document is related to a litigation. If the flag is set the document must never be deleted - even if the retention date has passed by.

To be able to store objects in the database we define a class for entity definitions.So an entity represents a type of data structure used in the arveo.There are five supported entity types. Document: an entity that can contain metadata and content. Documents are the only objects that can have content, the content may be binary. Documents can be contained in folders (Document). Container: simple folder-like object not organized in a tree structure but with relations to other objects. A Container contains only metadata and cannot be contained in a folder (Container). Relation: an entity that represents a relation between two other entities. A relation can contain metadata (Relation). Folder: an entity that contains metadata and is organized in a tree structure like in a file system (Folder) Meta: an entity that contains only metadata. Unlike containers, metadata entities do not support system attributes like ID and creation date (Metadata) Each type definition is represented by one (or more) tables in the database. Each entity is referred by its system-wide unique id, which consists of a system id and its type definition id, followed by the sequential database id of this entity: [12bit System id][14bit Type Definition id][38bit Entity id]. All above listed entities (except for meta) are versioned by default. It means that they store version information, modification information. The class VersionInformation combines information about a version, including version id, version number and version comment. The version modification object stores a modification stamp, consisting of a user id and a ZonedDateTime object, both for the events of creation and last modification of the entity. The version information is stored in a separate table for each typed entity. When specifying a type definition, you can decide which attributes of this type definition are versioned. If none of the attributes are versioned, the entire object is not versioned. For the type Document the content changes are always versioned. You can make your class a type and add features by annotating your classes. You can define the custom metadata schema with simple getter and setter methods. When you start a project you have to create your own types. Simply annotate the class with the TYPE annotation and define your schema with type safe getter/setter methods (Example). You can find the arveo-specific annotations in the module type-definition-annotations. The goal is to create a type, and specify its properties. So annotations precisely define the behavior of the type definitions. When defining a type, a database table is created. To achieve this, you annotate the type definition with @Type. There is an exception to that: when annotating with @View or @Partial_View, no database table is created. There are 2 types of annotations: annotations on types (interfaces): @Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE}) annotations on properties (getter-methods): @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE}) Some annotations can be used both on interfaces and on getter-methods. The annotation ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE is used for inherited annotations. The following annotation groups are used in arveo: constraint: contains annotations that define specific properties or behaviour of attributes; defaults: contains annotations that define default values of attributes; index: contains annotations that define indexes on type definitions; naming: contains annotations that specify names for tables, attribute definitions, type definitions, enumeration types and enumeration values; reference: contains annotations that specify references between types or attributes; system: contains annotations that concern system properties; view: contains annotations that mark an interfaces as view; other: contains annotations like @Type, @EcrIgnore and others, which stand out and cannot be classified into a group. You can use the 5 entity classes to create custom entity types to serve the needs of your system.The customized entity types reflect the structure of your project or organization and can be created in a flexible way by extending the five entity types of the arveo system. You can make your class a type and add features by annotating your classes.You can define the custom metadata schema with simple getter and setter methods. To create your first project using arveo you may want to review the following examples and follow the pattern. There are two different ways custom metadata can be stored for an entity: As an attribute, which is defined by a getter and setter method in the type definition class and gets stored in a separate column in the database, and as a variable, which are stored in a JSON structure in a system field in the database.Attributes must be defined in the type definition. Changes to the available attributes require an update of the database schema.Variables can be added and removed without changing the database schema. It is possible to use variables when searching for an entity, but the available query operations are limited.It is also not possible to use variables for references like foreign keys. Variables are an optional feature of a type definition that can be enabled by adding the @Variables annotation to the type interface. To access variables, a getter for the respective system field can be used as shown in the following example: Getter for variables @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.VARIABLES) Map<String, Object> getVariables(); The names of variables must comply to the same rules as attribute names as defined by the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*. Variables do not support null values. The following Java data types are supported for variable values: Integer Long String Boolean Double LocalDate LocalTime ZonedDateTime UUID Enums Variables can be stored by providing a Map<String, Object> to the respective input type: Storing variables Map<String, Object> variables = Map.of(\"myVariable\", \"some value\", \"myIntVariable\", 1); client = serviceClient.create( new TypedContainerInput<>(null, typeInstance, null, variables)); To update variables, simply provide a map with the updated values. Other variables that might already be present in the entity will not be changed. Updating variables Map<String, Object> variables = Map.of(\"myIntVariable\", 2, \"newVariable\", true); client = client.update( new TypedContainerInput<>( null, serviceClient.createTypeInstance(), null, variables ) ); To remove a variable, set it’s value to new AttributeNullValue() in an update operation. Removing variables Map<String, Object> variables = Map.of(\"newVariable\", new AttributeNullValue()); client = client.update( new TypedContainerInput<>( null, serviceClient.createTypeInstance(), null, variables ) ); The following examples show how variables can be used when searching for entities. Search for a variable with a specific value List<TypedContainerClient<RegisteredContainer>> list = serviceClient.where() .variable(\"uuid\").withEntityAlias().equalTo().value(uuid).holds().unpaged(); Search for entities that contain a variable with a specific name @NotNull List<TypedContainerClient<RegisteredContainer>> list = serviceClient.where() .variable(\"uuid\").withEntityAlias().isDefined().holds().unpaged(); Search for entities that do not contain a variable with a specific name @NotNull List<TypedContainerClient<RegisteredContainer>> list = serviceClient.where() .variable(\"nosuchvariable\").withEntityAlias().isUndefined().holds().unpaged(); Certain properties of annotations have a wide usage throughout the code, so it is therefore more convenient to define a certain annotation once for frequent usage. The following is a listing of the interface definition @CustomAnnotation, which defines itself as a system property version id.If you mark a getter-method with this annotation, there is no need to list the system property name. Listing of the interface @CustomAnnotation @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE}) @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.VERSION_ID) public @interface CustomAnnotation { } To take advantage of this interface, we annotate getter-methods with it as shown in the listing below: public interface InterfaceInheritanceExample { @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) DocumentId getId(); @CustomAnnotation VersionId getVersionId(); } Define a enum class and use it in a another object type (Example). @Enumeration(typeName = \"my_enum\") public enum MyEnum { ENUM1, ENUM2, ENUM3, ENUM4 } Example of a type definition using the object type Document @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) (1) @RetentionProtected @ContentElement(defaultDefinition = true, separateField = true) @OverwriteAllowed @RecycleBin @Audit public interface Resume { // Immutable identifier documentid of the resume document: unique and readonly @Unique @ReadOnly // alternatively: use autoincrement instead of unique and readonly to let the service create a unique sequence //@Autoincrement long getDocumentId(); (2) void setDocumentId(long value); // title of the resume document String getTitle(); (2) void setTitle(String value); // relation to Person by person.id() @ForeignKey (target = Person.class, targetProperty = \"id\") (3) String getPersonId(); void setPersonId(String value); // Multi value with former employers List<String> getEmployers(); void setEmployers(List<String> employers); MyEnum getEnum(); void setEnum(MyEnum myEnum); } 1 Definition of the object type to allow Document to upload content 2 A database column is created for this property with a default name DocumentId. The column is readonly, mandatory, autoincrement and unique. The database creates a sequence of integer values. The value is readonly and so immutable. This allows users and 3rd party applications to identify and find the object. If you leave the @Autoincrement annotation the id must be set on creation and is readonly and immutable from that moment on. 3 This annotation specifies a foreign key to class Person The following example class is marked as type Container. To use an entity type, we annotate the class using the @Type annotation. Example of an object definition of entity type Container @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) (1) public interface Person { String getFirstName(); (2) void setFirstName(String value); @Name(\"last_name\") (3) String getSurname(); void setSurname(String value); @Unique (4) String getVatNumber(); void setVatNumber(String value); } 1 Definition of the object type to be Container 2 A database column is created for this property with a default name first_name 3 This annotation specifies the name of the database column, which is different from the default 4 This annotation specifies a unique column, in this case vat_number. The system creates a column for each attribute of a type definition in the type definition’s database table. The name of the column will be a snake case representation of the camel case name of the getter method of the attribute. For example, the getter getInvoiceNumber will be mapped to an attribute (and a column) named invoice_number. To make it easy to reference these names in a compile-safe manner, classes with string constants for all type definitions will be generated automatically. For example, for a type definition class called SimpleInvoice a class named SimpleInvoiceNames will be generated in the same package as SimpleInvoice. The classes containing the constants are generated using an annotation processor that is contained in the library containing the type annotations. The processor is picked up by the compiler automatically. The following example shows how these constants can be used to perform a search referencing two different attributes. Example of a search using generated attribute name constants EcrSearchService<SimpleInvoice> searchService = serviceClient.asEntitySearchService(); (1) List<SimpleInvoice> list = searchService.where() (2) .entity().field(SimpleInvoiceNames.INVOICE_NUMBER).like().value(\"2021-08-*\") .and() .entity().field(SimpleInvoiceNames.AMOUNT).greaterThan().value(90D) .holds() .unpaged(); 1 serviceClient is a TypedDocumentServiceClient obtained using the TypeDefinitionServiceClient 2 A query is formulated using the fluent API of the EQL using the attributes invoice_number and amount","title":"Entity types","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"entity-types","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/entity-types.html","titles":[{"text":"Versioned entities","hash":"versioned_entities","id":1},{"text":"Custom types","hash":"custom_types","id":2},{"text":"Variables","hash":"variables","id":3},{"text":"Storing variables","hash":"storing_variables","id":4},{"text":"Updating variables","hash":"updating_variables","id":5},{"text":"Removing variables","hash":"removing_variables","id":6},{"text":"Searching","hash":"searching","id":7},{"text":"Inherited annotations","hash":"inherited_annotations","id":8},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_entity_types_examples","id":9},{"text":"Enumeration example","hash":"enumeration_example","id":10},{"text":"Document type example","hash":"_document_type_example","id":11},{"text":"Container type example","hash":"container_type_example","id":12},{"text":"Referencing attributes by name","hash":"referencing_attributes_by_name","id":13}]},"38":{"id":38,"text":"The arveo service publishes several different kinds of events internally for the following actions: Create Update Batch-Update Delete Retention prolongation Litigation hold Read content Create content Delete content Events are named after the operation they are published for and have one of the following three prefixes: Before On After \"Before\" events are published before an operation takes place but within the same transaction. They contain information about the input of the change. If a synchronous event listener throws an exception the change will be omitted, and the transaction aborted. \"On\" events are published after a change occurred but within the same transaction. They will contain information about the result of a change. If a synchronous event listener throws an exception the change will not be omitted, but the transaction will be aborted. \"After\" events are published after the transaction containing the change was committed successfully. They will contain information about the result of a change. If a synchronous event listener throws an exception the change will not be omitted, and the transaction will not be aborted. The call itself however will fail while actually being successful. Thus, it is considered good practice to define listeners for after events as asynchronous. Available events are implemented in the module ecr-events, which can be found at the following maven coordinates: <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-events</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> </dependency> The arveo service uses spring eventing as implementation, enabling asynchronous events. Thus, events can be handled by defining a Spring bean or component, containing a method annotated with @EventListener: Example of an Event Listener, listening to all events import de.eitco.ecr.event.EcrEvent; import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; @Component public class EventLog { private final Stack<EcrEvent> events = new Stack<>(); public Stack<EcrEvent> getEvents() { return events; } @EventListener public void onEvent(EcrEvent event) { events.push(event); } } The code above defines an Event Listender that adds every arveo event to a stack. However, more specific events can be listened to, as well: Example of an Event Listener, listening to specific events import de.eitco.ecr.event.content.after.AfterDeleteContentEvent; import de.eitco.ecr.event.document.after.AfterCreateDocumentEvent; import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; @Component public class EventListeners { @EventListener public void afterCreateDocument(AfterCreateDocumentEvent event) { // ... code that handles event } @EventListener public void afterDeleteContent(AfterDeleteContentEvent event) { // ... code that handles event } } Events are fired and handled inside of the arveo service. Currently, there is no eventing mechanism avaibale for the client APIs. Because of this, the Spring component containing the event listener methods must be present in the classpath of the arveo service. To ensure that the component is registered as a bean, it is required to implement a Spring Boot starter with the according auto import declaration. arveo can forward the after…​ events to message queues. This makes it possible for external services to react to certain events. The message queues and the types of events to forward can be configured in the configuration of the Content Repository Service. Only events fired after an action was performed can be forwarded. By default, no events will be forwarded. The following example configuration shows how to forward all available events to different message queues. forwarding configuration ecr: server: messaging: forwarding: afterCreate: containerQueueName: ecr-after-create-container-events documentQueueName: ecr-after-create-document-events folderQueueName: ecr-after-create-folder-events relationQueueName: ecr-after-create-relation-events metaDataQueueName: ecr-after-create-meta-events afterUpdate: containerQueueName: ecr-after-update-container-events documentQueueName: ecr-after-update-document-events folderQueueName: ecr-after-update-folder-events relationQueueName: ecr-after-update-relation-events metaDataQueueName: ecr-after-update-meta-events afterBatchUpdate: containerQueueName: ecr-after-batch-update-container-events documentQueueName: ecr-after-batch-update-document-events folderQueueName: ecr-after-batch-update-folder-events relationQueueName: ecr-after-batch-update-relation-events metaDataQueueName: ecr-after-batch-update-meta-events afterDelete: containerQueueName: ecr-after-delete-container-events documentQueueName: ecr-after-delete-document-events folderQueueName: ecr-after-delete-folder-events relationQueueName: ecr-after-delete-relation-events metaDataQueueName: ecr-after-delete-meta-events afterRetentionProlongation: containerQueueName: ecr-after-retention-prolongation-container-events documentQueueName: ecr-after-retention-prolongation-document-events folderQueueName: ecr-after-retention-prolongation-folder-events relationQueueName: ecr-after-retention-prolongation-relation-events afterLitigationHold: containerQueueName: ecr-after-litigation-hold-container-events documentQueueName: ecr-after-litigation-hold-document-events folderQueueName: ecr-after-litigation-hold-folder-events relationQueueName: ecr-after-litigation-hold-relation-events afterCreateContentQueueName: ecr-after-create-content-events afterReadContentQueueName: ecr-after-read-content-events afterDeleteContentQueueName: ecr-after-delete-content-events Only event types with a configured message queue name will be forwarded. As it is not possible to forward the internal event classes, the events will be converted to serializable event classes. The available classes are contained in the package de.eitco.ecr.common.events. These events will be serialized to JSON when they are sent to the message queues. The arveo SDK for Spring applications provides a preconfigured JmsTemplate which will automatically deserialize the events. The following dependency is required to access the preconfigured JmsTemplate: jms dependency <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-jms</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> </dependency> The preconfigured JmsTemplate can then by obtained by injecting an EcrJmsTemplateHolder as shown below: @Autowired private EcrJmsTemplateHolder ecrJmsTemplateHolder; The JmsTemplate can then be used to receive events. The following example shows how to listen to a specific queue synchronously. listening to events JmsTemplate jmsTemplate = ecrJmsTemplateHolder.getJmsTemplate(); AfterUpdateDocumentEvent event = (AfterUpdateDocumentEvent) jmsTemplate.receiveAndConvert( new ActiveMQQueue(\"ecr-after-update-document-events\")); The ecr-jms module also registers JmsListenerContainerFactory beans that can be used to programmatically register JMS listeners in a Spring application. The following example shows an example of a component that adds a custom message listener using the preconfigured JmsListenerContainerFactory: registering event listeners @Component public class MyListenerRegistration implements JmsListenerConfigurer { private final JmsListenerContainerFactory<DefaultMessageListenerContainer> queueListenerContainerFactory; @Autowired public AbstractListenerRegistration( @Qualifier(\"ecr-queue-listener-container-factory\") JmsListenerContainerFactory<DefaultMessageListenerContainer> queueListenerContainerFactory (1) ) { this.queueListenerContainerFactory = queueListenerContainerFactory; } @Override public void configureJmsListeners(@NotNull JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) { SimpleJmsListenerEndpoint endpoint = new SimpleJmsListenerEndpoint(); (2) endpoint.setId(\"my-listener-id\"); endpoint.setDestination(\"my-queue-name\"); endpoint.setMessageListener(new MyMessageListener()); registrar.registerEndpoint(endpoint, queueListenerContainerFactory); (3) } } 1 Injects the preconfigured JmsListenerContainerFactory provided by the ecr-jms library. 2 Create a custom listener endpoint. 3 Register the custom listener endpoint using the preconfigured container factory The custom event listener can be implemented by extending de.eitco.ecr.jms.ConvertingMessageListener. This abstract class provides automatic deserialization of the message objects. custom event listener @Component public class MyMessageListener extends ConvertingMessageListener<EventType> { @Autowired public MyMessageListener(MessageConverter messageConverter) { super(messageConverter, EventType.class); (1) } @Override protected void handleMessage(@NotNull ActiveMQMessage activeMQMessage, @NotNull EventType event) { (2) // the actual event processing happens here } } 1 Pass the injected MessageConverter to the abstract listener.

The following diagram shows the data model of the example scenario: Figure 1. Data model of the example The scenario contains two type definitions. The EmployeeFile definition is a container type holding the metadata of the employee. The EmployeeDocument is a document type that contains documents related to the employee, like a curriculum vitae. The following code snippets show the two type definitions: The EmployeeFile type definiton @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) @RecycleBin (1) public interface EmployeeFile { @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) ContainerId getEmployeeId(); @Mandatory @Unique String getName(); void setName(String name); LocalDate getBirthday(); void setBirthday(LocalDate date); } The EmployeeDocument Type definiton @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @RecycleBin (1) public interface EmployeeDocument { @ForeignKey(target = EmployeeFile.class, targetProperty = \"id\") @ReadOnly @CascadeDelete (2) ContainerId getEmployeeId(); (3) void setEmployeeId(ContainerId employeeFileId); @Optional String getDescription(); void setDescription(String description); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) DocumentId getDocumentId(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CONTENT) Map<String, ContentInformation> getContentInformation(); } 1 Enables the recycle bin feature 2 Enables cascading delete and recycle operations 3 The attribute defining the foreign key relation The foreign key relation between the two type definitions is defined by adding an attribute called employee_id to the EmployeeDocument type. The attribute is annotated with @ForeignKey, defining the target type and the target attribute of the foreign key that will be created on the database. The target type is defined by the class name of the referenced type definition. The target attribute has to be defined by name. As a foreign key target attribute must be a unique key, the system attribute id of the EmployeeFile type is the obvious choice. The data type of the attribute must be compatible to the refrenced attribute. For the ID system property, both the typed ID classes like ContainerId or the raw type of the ID value (long) can be used. The foreign key attribute employee_id is annotated with @CascadeDelete, which will cause all documents referenced by one employee file to be deleted automatically when the employee file is deleted. The employee_id attribute is annotated with @ReadOnly, too. This means that the employee ID must be set when a new EmployeeDocument is created and that it cannot be changed by subsequent update calls on the entity. Using the @CascadeDelete annotation it is possible to enable cascading deletes for entities referenced by foreign keys. A cascading delete will delete the entity with the foreign key, when the referenced entity is deleted. Foreign keys with cascading delete cannot be used in type definitions that support retention. Also, no delete event will be fired when an entity is deleted by a cascading delete operation. When the recycle bin feature is used, the entity moved to the recycle bin is not actually deleted. Therefore, no cascading deletes will be performed in this case until the entity is actually deleted. However, entities referencing an entity that is moved to the recycle bin will be moved to the recycle bin, too. This of course will only happen when the type definition containing the referencing entities supports the recycle bin feature. The following code snipped shows how to create a new employee file entity. The TypeDefinitionServiceClient and BatchOperationServiceClient instances used in the examples can be obtained using dependency injection. Creating a new Employee file TypedContainerServiceClient<EmployeeFile> employeeFileServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getContainerServiceClient().byClass(EmployeeFile.class); (1) EmployeeFile employeeFile = employeeFileServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); (2) employeeFile.setName(\"Carl Carlson\"); employeeFile.setBirthday(LocalDate.of(1985, 10, 7)); TypedContainerClient<EmployeeFile> employeeClient = employeeFileServiceClient.createEntity(employeeFile); (3) TypedDocumentServiceClient<EmployeeDocument> documentServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(EmployeeDocument.class); (4) EmployeeDocument document = documentServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); (5) document.setEmployeeId(employeeClient.getIdentifier()); (6) document.setDescription(\"Curriculum Vitae\"); ContentUpload upload = new ContentUpload(\"curriculum_vitae.docx\", null, null, inputStream); (7) TypedDocumentInput<EmployeeDocument> input = new TypedDocumentInput<>(Map.of(\"content\", upload), document); documentServiceClient.create(input); (8) 1 Obtain a service client for the EmployeeFile type definition 2 Create the entity and add metadata 3 Save the EmployeeFile and get a client for the new entity 4 Obtain a service client for the EmployeeDocument type definition 5 Create the document entity and add metadata 6 Set the value of the foreign key attribute to link the document to the employee file 7 Create a ContentUpload for the actual document content 8 Save the document The following code snippet shows how to load an employee file by searching for the employee’s name and how to list all documents related to the file. Loading an Employee file TypedContainerServiceClient<EmployeeFile> employeeFileServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getContainerServiceClient().byClass(EmployeeFile.class); (1) Optional<TypedContainerClient<EmployeeFile>> clients = employeeFileServiceClient.where().entity().field(EmployeeFileNames.NAME).equalTo().value(\"Carl Carlson\") .holds().uniqueResult(); (2) EmployeeFile employeeFile = clients.get().getEntity(); TypedDocumentServiceClient<EmployeeDocument> documentServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(EmployeeDocument.class); (3) List<TypedDocumentClient<EmployeeDocument>> documentClients = documentServiceClient.where().entity().field(EmployeeDocumentNames.EMPLOYEE_ID) .equalTo().value(employeeFile.getEmployeeId()).holds().unpaged(); (4) 1 Obtain a service client for the EmployeeFile type definition 2 Search for the file using the employee’s name 3 Obtain a service client for the EmployeeDocument type definition 4 List all documents that are related to the employee file Note that the query for the documents in the above example is using the EMPLOYEE_ID constant from the class EmployeeDocumentNames. This class is automatically created when the type definition classes are compiled. Using the batch API it is possible to create an EmployeeFile and a related EmployeeDocument in one transaction. The following code snippet shows how the batch API can be used to do that. Creating a file in one transaction TypedContainerServiceClient<EmployeeFile> employeeFileServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getContainerServiceClient().byClass(EmployeeFile.class); (1) EmployeeFile employeeFile = employeeFileServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); (2) employeeFile.setName(\"Waylon Smithers\"); employeeFile.setBirthday(LocalDate.of(1985, 10, 7)); TypedContainerBatchCreateInput<EmployeeFile> fileInput = new TypedContainerBatchCreateInput<>(new TypedContainerInput<>(employeeFile), List.of()); (3) TypedDocumentServiceClient<EmployeeDocument> documentServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(EmployeeDocument.class); (4) EmployeeDocument document = documentServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); (5) document.setDescription(\"Curriculum Vitae\"); ContentUpload upload = new ContentUpload(\"curriculum_vitae.docx\", null, null, inputStream); (6) final TypedDocumentBatchCreateInput<EmployeeDocument> documentInput = new TypedDocumentBatchCreateInput<>( (7) new TypedDocumentInput<>(Map.of(\"content\", upload), document), (8) List.of( new BatchAttributeReference( (9) EmployeeDocumentNames.EMPLOYEE_ID, SystemFieldList.GeneralSystemField.Id.INSTANCE.getName(), fileInput.getVirtualIdentifier().getUuid() (10) ) ) ); batchOperationServiceClient.createTypedEntities(fileInput, documentInput); (11) 1 Obtain a service client for the EmployeeFile type definition 2 Create the entity and add metadata 3 Create the batch input object that will create the EmployeeFile entity 4 Obtain a service client for the EmployeeFile type definition 5 Create the document entity and add metadata 6 Create a ContentUpload for the actual document content 7 Create the batch input that will create the EmployeeDocument entity 8 Create the regular typed document input holding the metadata and the content 9 Use a BatchAttributeReference to set the EMPLOYEE_ID attribute to the value of the system attribute ID of the EmployeeFile entity 10 The virtual identifier of the batch create input created in step 3 is used to reference the created entity 11 Perform the batch operation.Note that the order of the entities is important here.

The project generated by the archetype will consist of four modules: documentation implementation packaging test This module holds a frame for an asciidoc based documentation of your project. This module contains the actual source code. It is separated into five submodules. common This submodule contains classes that are available on the server side as well as the client side. generated This submodule contains modules that are automatically generated. Normally developers will not add code in these modules. They are however relevant for building the project. The following submodules exist serialization This submodule contains automatically generated serialization meta information. client This submodule contains a few submodules itself, holding client side applications for: a java spring based http client api, a java spring based embedded client api, a typescript http client api. jmeter-sampler This submodule generated jmeter samplers of the services api, usable in load tests. server This submodule contains the server side implementation. types this submodule contains the arveo based model. The generated interface named <class-name-prefix>Model describes an arveo type definition as will every interface you register in <class-name-prefix>TypeRegistration. The jar compiled by this module will be available on the server side and client side. Additionally, it needs to be in the class path of your arveo instance. For the system tests (se below) this is already taken care of. This module contains delivery artifacts to deliver the service to or with different runtimes. This includes: a stand-alone jar a java web archive (war) a helm chart for deployment in a kubernetes cluster This module contains a system test module. When building this module maven will start a complete arveo system (containing all required services) with the newly generated service in the pre-integration-test-phase so that tests written here (like the generated example <class-name-prefix>ClientIT) may simply call the new service via the generated http-client (see above). Most implementation will be done in the implementation\\server module since this contains the server side code. You api and model will be defined in the implementation\\common and implementation\\types modules. The later will only be used for classes that are part of your arveo model and need to be in the classpath of arveo. When testing your code, the test\\system-test module comes in handy. As mentioned above, it will start a complete arveo system so that your tests can simply use the generated http client api to test your functionality. However, you can use this to manually test and debug your service, too. In case you simply need to start up the environment, in the test\\system-test directory call: mvn -Denv If you want to debug your service call mvn -Denv -Dservice.skip This will start the environment except for your service. You can then start your service in debug mode from your IDE. In both cases you can now start tests manually or call the service api directly to test your code.","title":"Full-featured archetype","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"full-featured-archetype","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/full-featured-archetype.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview of the generated project","hash":"overview_of_the_generated_project","id":1},{"text":"The documentation module","hash":"the_documentation_module","id":2},{"text":"The implementation module","hash":"the_implementation_module","id":3},{"text":"The packaging module","hash":"the_packaging_module","id":4},{"text":"The test module","hash":"the_test_module","id":5},{"text":"Working on the generated project","hash":"working_on_the_generated_project","id":6}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"arveo can make use of the full text support of the PostgreSQL database. Extracted full text data can be stored in the database and used in queries in combination with all entity attributes and system properties. The PostgreSQL documentation contains an in-depth explanation of the database’s text search capabilities. Full text extraction and storage is configured in the type definition using annotations. The following example shows how to define a content element for which full text data will be extracted automatically and stored in PostgreSQL. type definition with full text in relational database @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @ContentElement( name = \"content1\", (1) fulltextExtraction = @FullTextExtraction( (2) fullTextLanguage = FullTextLanguage.ENGLISH, (3) reversedFullTextIndex = true (4) ) ) @ContentElement( name = \"content2\", fulltextExtraction = @FullTextExtraction( fullTextStorage = FullTextStorage.RDB_WITH_VECTOR_COLUMN, (5) fullTextLanguage = FullTextLanguage.ENGLISH, reversedFullTextIndex = true ) ) public interface DocumentWithRdbFullText { @Optional String getDocumentName(); void setDocumentName(String documentName); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.QUERY_ATTRIBUTES) QueryAttributes getQueryAttributes(); (6) @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.FULL_TEXT_EXTRACTION_STATUS) Map<String, FullTextStatusInformation> getFullTextStatusInformation(); (7) } 1 Defines the name of the content element 2 Activates automatic full text extraction 3 The language (or configuration) used for the full text index on the database 4 If this property is set to true, an additional index is created that contains full text data of the reversed original content. This is a requirement for suffix-searches. If suffix searches are not required, this setting should not be enabled. 5 Activates an additional column on the database that will contain the parsed full text vector data. See below for details. 6 Provides access to additional query result attributes like rank and highlighting 7 Provides access to status information about extracted full text data The system will create a full text index for each content element for that full text data is stored in the database. Because full text operations are language specific, the language for the index must be defined in the content element of the type definition. PostgreSQL provides a number of predefined language configurations, which are contained in the FullTextLanguage class as constants. It is possible to create custom configurations. More information can be found in the Postgres documentation. The parsed full text data can be kept in indexes and optionally in a separate database column (vector column). To store full text data in a vector column, set the fullTextStorage attribute to RDB_WITH_VECTOR_COLUMN. If storing the full text data in an index is sufficient, set this attribute to RDB. Whether to use a vector column depends on the usage of the archived data. Storing the data in a vector column provides faster search performance but slower write performance. Keeping the data in an index provides slower search performance but faster write performance. Another thing to consider is the possibility to change the language used to parse the full text data. If it is changed, both the index and the vector column must be re-created. To allow suffix or \"ends-with\" searches, an additional index or vector column that stores reversed full text data can be activated using the property reversedFullTextIndex. Such an index (or vector column) is required to perform suffix searches. Prefix and web searches are always possible. Keep in mind that enabling the storage of reversed full text data will double the amount of storage required for full text data, so this should only be enabled when suffix searches are required. The EQL provides support for full text searching. Search expressions are formulated like a query in a web search engine: Unquoted text: Text without quotes will be treated as individual terms combined by an AND operator. Quoted text: Text within quotes will be treated as a phrase (individual terms combined by a FOLLOWED-BY operator). OR: The word \"or\" will be treated like the logical OR operator. Dash: A dash (\"-\") will be treated like a NOT operator. Whether the full text data is stored in an index or a vector column does not matter when formulating queries. The system will automatically reference the correct database entity. Providing the name of the content element is sufficient. Examples: 'the green ball': Will find documents that contain the words \"green\" and \"ball\". The word \"the\" will be ignored because it is a stop-word. '\"the green ball\"': Will find documents that contain the word \"green\" followed by the word \"ball\". Again, the word \"the\" will be ignored. 'blue -red': Will find documents containing the word \"blue\" but not the word \"red\". 'blue or red': Will find documents containing the word \"blue\" or the word \"red\". The fluent API can be used to formulate queries as shown in the following example: formulating queries List<TypedDocumentClient<DocumentWithRdbFullText>> list = serviceClient.where() .contextReference(\"content1\") (1) .fullTextMatches() (2) .webSearch(\"the cake is a lie\") (3) .holds().unpaged(); 1 Defines the content element from which the full text data was extracted 2 Perform full text query 3 Define the web search expression as described above In queries using more than one type definition it is necessary to qualify the context reference to the content element by the name of the type definition: qualified context reference List<TypedDocumentClient<DocumentWithRdbFullText>> list = serviceClient.where() .contextReference(DocumentWithRdbFullTextNames.getTypeDefinitionName(), \"content1\") (1) .fullTextMatches() .webSearch(\"the cake is a lie\") .holds().unpaged(); 1 Qualify the reference to the content element by using the name of the type definition In addition to web searches, arveo supports prefix and suffix searches (or starts-with and ends-with) queries. prefix search List<TypedDocumentClient<DocumentWithRdbFullText>> list = serviceClient.where() .contextReference(\"content2\") .fullTextMatches() .prefix(\"search\") .holds().unpaged(); The extracted full text data is stored in a separate table (with the postfix \"_ft\"). This table is automatically joined when a full text query is performed. Queries without full text will not contain a join for this table. In full text queries ranking is used to measure the relevance of each query result in regard of the full text matching expression. arveo can return a rank value for each element in a query result. The value is of type float in the range 0-1. The rank value might be null if ranking was not applicable for the specific element. The rank is calculated for one specific content element, which means that the query must contain exactly one full text match expression for this content element. It is not possible to calculate more than one rank in a query. The calculated value can be used to order the returned result. The concrete rank of each returned element can be accessed using the QueryAttributes property of an entity. Ranking is an expensive operation on the database and should be used with care. Ranking is enabled in the SearchOptions given to the SearchRequest as shown in the following example. ranking List<TypedDocumentClient<DocumentWithRdbFullText>> list = serviceClient.where() .contextReference(\"content1\") .fullTextMatches() .webSearch(\"the cake is a lie\") .holds() .withOptions() .withRankingByReference(\"content1\") (1) .asOptions() .order().descendingByRank() (2) .unpaged(); 1 Calculate the rank for the full text match expression on the content element named \"content\" 2 Use the calculated rank to order the result on the database The rank value can be accessed as shown below: accessing the rank value QueryAttributes queryAttributes = documentClient.getEntity().getQueryAttributes(); Float rank = queryAttributes.getRank(); arveo offers the possibility to generate a headline that can be used to highlight words that matched a full text query in a document. A client might use this feature to show a short preview of the document in a query result list so that the user can see why the document was considered relevant. The headline is generated for one specific content element, which means that the query must contain exactly one full text match expression for this content element. It is not possible to generate more than one headline in a query. The generation of the headline is done by the database and must therefore be enabled in the SearchOptions as shown in the following example. Generating headlines is an expensive operation on the database and should be used with care. headline List<TypedDocumentClient<DocumentWithRdbFullText>> list = serviceClient.where() .contextReference(\"content1\") .fullTextMatches() .webSearch(\"the cake is a lie\") .holds() .withOptions() .withHeadlineForReference(\"content1\") (1) .asOptions() .unpaged(); 1 Generate a headline for the extracted full text data of the content element called \"content\". The headline value can be accessed as shown below: accessing the headline value QueryAttributes queryAttributes = documentClient.getEntity().getQueryAttributes(); @Nullable String headline = queryAttributes.getHeadline(); It is not possible to retrieve a headline when a suffix search is performed. arveo keeps track of the status of the extracted full text data for each document and content element. The current status can be retrieved from a document entity using a system property getter for full text information as shown in the type definition above: accessing the status value RenditionStatus status = client.getEntity().getFullTextStatusInformation().get(\"content1\").getStatus(); Fulltext extraction is retried automatically for each document. The number of retries can be configured using the property ecr.server.messaging.redelivery.maximum-redeliveries. When all attempts have failed, the status is set to FAILED. It is possible to reset the status using the API as shown below. A system job will detect these document and the system will try to extract the full text data again. Triggers for this job are created automatically by the system at startup for each type definition containing content elements with full text extraction. By default, the job is triggered every three minutes. resetting the status value SearchRequest searchRequest = SearchRequest .first(100) .ascendingBy(SystemFieldList.GeneralSystemField.Id.INSTANCE.getName()) .matching(EcrQueryLanguage.condition().entity().id().equalTo().value(client.getIdentifier()).holds()); (1) serviceClient.resetFailedFullTextExtractionStatus(searchRequest, \"content1\"); (2) 1 The selector used to identify the documents to reset the status 2 Resets the status for all documents matching the condition for the content element \"content1\"","title":"Using full text features of the relational database","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"fulltext","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/fulltext.html","titles":[{"text":"Store extracted full text data in the relational database","hash":"store_extracted_full_text_data_in_the_relational_database","id":1},{"text":"Indexes and configuration","hash":"indexes_and_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Using vector columns","hash":"using_vector_columns","id":3},{"text":"Suffix (ends-with) searches","hash":"suffix_ends_with_searches","id":4},{"text":"Searching","hash":"searching","id":5},{"text":"Ranking search results","hash":"ranking_search_results","id":6},{"text":"Highlighting","hash":"highlighting","id":7},{"text":"Error handling","hash":"error_handling","id":8}]},"43":{"id":43,"text":"The following chapter describes the inheritance scheme, used in arveo.

The arveo component resides in the Maven repository at the following coordinates: <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-integration-service-endpoint</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> </dependency> The component provides access to arveo from Apache Camel. It uses the client SDK, which communicates with arveo over HTTP. The arveo component provides two Camel endpoints for inclusion in a route. A URL endpoint and a bean endpoint for Groovy scripts. The URL endpoint’s URL has the format ecr:typedefinition. Here, 'typedefinition' specifies the name of the type definition where the object should be stored. The URL endpoint can be used for simple create or upload operations. The script endpoint offers more flexibility as it makes it possible to use the entire feature set of the client SDK. The following example shows a route where a document with the content of a file and an attribute named \"filename\" is created in arveo. The type definition used is named \"files\". The content of the file is stored in a content element called \"content\". At the end of the route the file is copied to another directory. Example of the route to upload a document package scripts.routes import de.eitco.commons.integration.core.ExceptionProcessor import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder return new RouteBuilder() { @Override void configure() throws Exception { onException(Exception.class) .process(new ExceptionProcessor()) .handled(true) .maximumRedeliveries(0) from(\"file://directory/input?noop=true\") .routeId(\"test-route\") .setHeader(\"ecr-attribute:filename\", simple('${file:onlyname}')) .setHeader(\"ecr-content-name\", constant('content')) .to(\"ecr://files\") .to(\"file://directory/output\") } } In the following example, a container is created in arveo. The container is stored in the type definition \"test_containers\" and has an attribute named \"filename\". The creation of meta data entities is done analogously. Which type of object is created in arveo depends only on the type definition used. Example of a route uploading a container package scripts.routes import de.eitco.commons.integration.core.ExceptionProcessor import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder return new RouteBuilder() { @Override void configure() throws Exception { onException(Exception.class) .process(new ExceptionProcessor()) .handled(true) .maximumRedeliveries(0) from(\"file://directory/input?noop=true\") .routeId(\"test-route\") .setHeader(\"ecr-attribute:filename\", simple('${file:onlyname}')) .to(\"ecr://test_containers\") .to(\"file://directory/output\") } } In the following example, a document and a container are created first. Then a relation is created between the two. Note that after creating or updating an object, the arveo endpoint stores the object in the Camel Exchange as a property so that it can be accessed in the route. In the example, this procedure is used to define the parent and child of the relation to be created. The document, the container and the relation each contain exactly one attribute called \"filename\". Example of a route creating a relation package scripts.routes import de.eitco.commons.integration.core.ExceptionProcessor import de.eitco.commons.integration.ecr.EcrComponent import de.eitco.commons.lang.Unsafe import de.eitco.ecr.common.meta.MetaDataEntity import de.eitco.ecr.common.search.EcrQueryLanguage import org.apache.camel.Exchange import org.apache.camel.Expression import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder return new RouteBuilder() { @Override void configure() throws Exception { onException(Exception.class) .process(new ExceptionProcessor()) .handled(true) .maximumRedeliveries(0) from(\"file://test-classes/input?noop=true\") .routeId(\"test-route\") .setHeader(\"ecr-attribute:filename\", simple('${file:onlyname}')) // create document .setHeader(EcrComponent.HEADER_CONTENT_NAME, constant('content')) .to(\"ecr://test_documents\") .log(\"Document created\") .setHeader(EcrComponent.HEADER_RELATION_CHILD, exchangeProperty(EcrComponent.PROPERTY_ENTITY)) // create container .to(\"ecr://test_containers\") .log(\"Container created\") .setHeader(EcrComponent.HEADER_RELATION_PARENT, exchangeProperty(EcrComponent.PROPERTY_ENTITY)) // create relation document -> container .to(\"ecr://test_relation\") .log(\"Relation created\") // create meta entity .to(\"ecr://test_meta_data\") .log(\"Meta data entity created.\") // copy file to output .to(\"file://test-classes/output\") } } It is also possible to update existing objects. To do this, you just need to set the \"ecr-entity-id\" header. It can contain both the ID of an object and an EQL expression. The expression must identify exactly one object. It is important to remove the header after the update, so that later calls of the arveo Enpoint do not access the object again. The expression created in the header is an org.apache.camel.expression. The return value of the evaluate method is a de.eitco.commons.search.api.language.Expression. Example of a route updating an entity ... // update container .setHeader(\"ecr-attribute:filename\", constant('updated')) .setHeader(EcrComponent.HEADER_ENTITY_ID, exchangeProperty(EcrComponent.PROPERTY_ENTITY)) .to(\"ecr://test_containers\") .log(\"Container updated\") .setHeader(\"ecr-attribute:filename\", simple('${file:onlyname}')) .removeHeader(EcrComponent.HEADER_ENTITY_ID) // update meta entity .setHeader(\"ecr-attribute:filename\", constant('updated')) .setHeader(EcrComponent.HEADER_ENTITY_ID, new Expression() { @Override def <T> T evaluate(Exchange exchange, Class<T> type) { def entity = exchange.getProperty(EcrComponent.PROPERTY_ENTITY, MetaDataEntity.class) return Unsafe.cast(EcrQueryLanguage.condition().field(\"counter\").equalTo() .value(entity.getAttributes().get(\"counter\")).holds()) } }) .to(\"ecr://test_meta_data\") .log(\"Meta data entity updated\") In addition to the generic URL endpoint, the arveo component also includes a script endpoint. This endpoint can be used to run Groovy scripts that use the arveo API. Each script is passed the following variables: typeDefinitionServiceClient: Contains an instance of de.eitco.ecr.sdk.TypeDefinitionServiceClient systemManagementClient: Contains an instance of de.eitco.ecr.sdk.SystemManagementClient, batchOperationServiceClient: Contains an instance of de.eitco.ecr.sdk.BatchOperationServiceClient, searchClient: Contains an instance of de.eitco.ecr.sdk.SearchClient, camelExchange: Contains the current org.apache.camel.Exchange camelContext: Contains the current org.apache.camel.CamelContext. The script endpoint can be used in a route like the following example. It provides two methods: execute and voidExecute. The execute method sets the return value of the script as the new body of the current Camel message. The voidExecute method ignores the return value of the script. The endpoint consists of a bean called ecrScriptWrapper that is able to execute Groovy scripts that perform the actual interaction with the arveo service. Example of a route using a script endpoint package scripts.routes import de.eitco.commons.integration.core.ExceptionProcessor import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder ... return new RouteBuilder() { @Override void configure() throws Exception { onException(Exception.class) .process(new ExceptionProcessor()) .handled(true) .maximumRedeliveries(0) from(\"file://test-classes/input?noop=true\") .routeId(\"test-route\") .to(\"bean://ecrScriptWrapper?method=voidExecute('common/EcrScript.groovy')\") .to(\"file://test-classes/output\") } } The script used in the example creates a new document with the contents of the read file. The return value of the script is a DocumentClient for the new document: Example of a script being used by the route described above package scripts.common import de.eitco.commons.integration.ecr.EcrProducer import de.eitco.ecr.common.document.DocumentInput import de.eitco.ecr.sdk.TypeDefinitionServiceClient import org.apache.camel.Exchange import org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFile LOG.info(\"ecr script started...\") TypeDefinitionServiceClient typeServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient Exchange exchange = camelExchange def serviceClient = typeServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byName(\"test_documents2\") def documentInput = new DocumentInput( Map.of(\"filename\", ((GenericFile) exchange.getIn().getBody()).fileNameOnly), Map.of(\"content\", EcrProducer.getContentUploadFromBody(exchange.getIn().getBody()))) ) serviceClient.create(documentInput) The arveo endpoint can log into the ECR using either OAuth2 or x509. Using OAuth2, the ECR endpoint logs in to the arveo as a concrete user. The user’s credentials must be specified in the integration service configuration file: ecr-endpoint: oauth2: user-name: \"username\" password: \"password\" Additionally, the Spring Security OAuth2 framework used must be configured: spring: security: oauth2: client: registration: keycloak-password: provider: keycloak client-id: \"testclient\" client-secret: \"yx7n6di3kXZ4p3Kj2oY1Js9NW7hbOCjh\" authorization-grant-type: \"password\" scope: openid provider: keycloak: issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:8180/realms/TestRealm\" For x509, the certificate to be used by the HTTP client must be configured. Since Oauth2 is the default, it must be turned off and x509 must be turned on: spring: security: oauth2: client: enabled: false security: x509: client: enabled: true http: client: ssl: key-store: /path/service-user.p12 key-store-type: PKCS12 key-store-password: changeit client-auth: true","title":"Enterprise Integration Service","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"integration-service","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/integration-service.html","titles":[{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":1},{"text":"URL endpoint","hash":"url_endpoint","id":2},{"text":"Document upload","hash":"document_upload","id":3},{"text":"Creating a Container or Metadata Entity","hash":"creating_a_container_or_metadata_entity","id":4},{"text":"Create relation","hash":"create_relation","id":5},{"text":"Update an existing object","hash":"update_an_existing_object","id":6},{"text":"Script endpoint","hash":"script_endpoint","id":7},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"authentication","id":8},{"text":"Oauth2","hash":"oauth2","id":9},{"text":"x509","hash":"x509","id":10}]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"Metadata types are used for example to connect external tables.

This is an optional feature of a type definition that can be enabled using the @AccessChecks(true) annotation. The following type level access rights exist: READ: Allows a user to read entities and to perform search operations. INSERT: Allows a user to create new entities. UPDATE: Allows a user to update existing entities. DELETE: Allows a user to delete existing entities or to recycle and restore entities. ASSIGN_ACCESS_RIGHTS: Allows a user to assign access rights to an entity. WRITE: Combines the rights INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and ASSIGN_ACCESS_RIGHTS. To assign type level access rights to a user, the user must be granted the required authorities. The authorities consist of the prefix ECR-TYPE_ followed by the ID or the name of the type definition followed by the granted access right. For instance, to grant a user the UPDATE right on the type definition with ID 12345, the authority ECR-TYPE_12345_UPDATE is required. To grant the READ right on a type definition named invoice, the authority ECR-TYPE_invoice_READ is required. Additionally, there are two additional authorities ECR_ALL_TYPES_READ and ECR_ALL_TYPES_WRITE, which give a user read or write access to all type definitions. The check of the permissions on the type definitions can also be disabled completely using the switch ecr.server.security.type-definition-access-checks-enabled (true/false). Within a folder structure, child elements of a parent folder can belong to different type definitions. To filter the result, the user’s permissions on the type definitions are used. This means that a user will only see folders and documents from type definitions for which he or she has read permission. Permissions of folders are inherited to the documents. For example, if a document of a type definition to which the user has read permission is located in a folder on whose type definition the user does not have read permission, the user is not allowed to access the document either. The folder permissions are currently only checked for the direct parent folder. There is no inheritance within the folder hierarchy.

A Relation represents a connection between two entities (document, container, folder or meta). It is directed, having a parent and a child and it can contain custom metadata attributes. A Relation type must specify the type of the parent and child entities. Any number of versions can be created for a Relation. All the versions are traceable in the repository and can be referenced via independent IDs. Changes of the child-id or parent-id are not tracked in the version table. Figure 1. Data model of a Relation Example: A Relation type definition @Type(ObjectType.RELATION) (1) @SourceType(Customer.class) (2) @TargetType(Invoice.class) (3) public interface CustomerInvoiceRelation { @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CHILD_ID) (4) @InputProperty(InputPropertyName.RELATION_CHILD) (5) DocumentId getChildId(); void setChildId(DocumentId childId); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.PARENT_ID) (6) @InputProperty(InputPropertyName.RELATION_PARENT) (7) ContainerId getParentId(); void setParentId(ContainerId parentId); String getStatus(); void setStatus(String status); } 1 Specifies that the type definition is used for relations 2 Defines the type of the source or parent of the relation 3 Defines the type of the target or child of the relation 4 Marks an attribute to return the value of the childId property of the relation 5 Marks an attribute to set the value of the childId property of the relation 6 Marks an attribute to return the value of the parentId property of the relation 7 Marks an attribute to set the value of the parentId property of the relation Instead of using relations, it is possible to model a dependency between two entities using foreign keys. The key difference between the two approaches is that a relation can carry its own metadata attributes, which a foreign key can not. This possibility requires an additional database table (or two, in case of versioned relations) for a relation, which might have a negative impact on the performance. If the dependency between the two entities does not require its own metadata attributes (and is not a many-to-many relation), it is recommended to use foreign keys instead of relations. Foreign keys can be defined by adding the @ForeignKey annotation to an attribute in a type definition. The targetProperty attribute of the annotation must point to the ID or to a custom metadata attribute with a unique constraint of the target type. The type of the annotated attribute must match the type of the target property of the foreign key. The chapter Foreign Keys contains a more detailed overview of the foreign key feature. Example: Defining a foreign key @ForeignKey(name = \"fk_invoice_customer\", target = Customer.class, targetProperty = \"id\") long getCustomerNumber(); Figure 2. Data model of a foreign key relationship By default, a relation can point to the current version or to a specific version of its parent or child, when the parent- or child-type supports versions. This behavior can be controlled by the supportedNodeVersion property of the @Source and @Target annotations used for relation type definitions. The attribute supports three different values (defined in de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.reference.SupportedNodeVersion): Possible values of the supportedNodeVersion attribute Value Meaning CURRENT_VERSION The relation must point to the current version of the node identified by the node’s ID (NOT the VersionId of the current version) SPECIFIC_VERSION The relation must point to a specific version of the node identified by it’s VersionId. CURRENT_OR_SPECIFIC_VERSION The relation can point to either the current version or a specific version of the node. This is the default. A single relation always has exactly one parent and one child.However, by default a single entity can be the parent or child of multiple relations (many-to-many).By adding unique constraints to the parentId and/or childId system properties of the relation type, it is possible to define one-to-many, many-to-one or one-to-one relations. Example: Adding a unique constraint to the child ID of a relation @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CHILD_ID) @Unique(constraintName = \"uccr_parent_child_uc\") ContainerId getChildId(); By using the @RelationCounter annotation it is possible to create counters on the parent- and child-entities for both incoming and outgoing relations.The counters are persisted in the database and are updated automatically when relations are added or removed. The @RelationCounter annotation contains two attributes: The relationType attribute defines the type of relation to count and the direction attribute defines whether to count incoming (the entity is the child or target of the relation) or outgoing (the entity is the parent or source of the relation).By annotating the relation counter attribute with @Versioned it is possible to control whether the counter attribute is stored in the version table for each version or in the main table for all versions.When the counter is stored in the version table it will contain the count for a single version of the entity.If it is stored in the main table it will contain the count for all versions of the entity.The following example shows how to define relation counter attributes.The @Name annotation is used because the attribute name is too long for a database column name. Example: Defining relation counter attributes @RelationCounter(relationType = TypedContainerContainerRelation.class, direction = RelationCounterDirection.INCOMING) @Versioned(false) int getIncomingRelationCounter(); @RelationCounter(relationType = TypedContainerContainerRelation.class, direction = RelationCounterDirection.INCOMING) @Versioned @Name(\"v_in_relation_counter\") int getVersionedIncomingRelationCounter(); The $arveo API provides several methods that can be used to create, modify and resolve relations. Relations itself are treated just like any other entity type. Entities, that can be the parent or child of a relation (containers, folders, documents and meta data entities), provide additional relation-specific methods in the client API. The available methods are defined in the interface de.eitco.ecr.sdk.TypedBaseRelationNodeEntityClient, which is a super interface of the clients used in the API for documents, folders, containers and meta data entities. The injectable de.eitco.ecr.sdk.SearchClient offers additional methods to search for relations using filters on the relation, the parent or the child.","title":"Relation type","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"relation-types","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/relation-types.html","titles":[{"text":"Relations vs. foreign keys","hash":"relations_vs_foreign_keys","id":1},{"text":"Relations to versions","hash":"relations_to_versions","id":2},{"text":"Unique relations","hash":"unique_relations","id":3},{"text":"Relation counters","hash":"relation_counters","id":4},{"text":"Working with relations","hash":"working_with_relations","id":5}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"Documents contain one or more content elements which are not stored in the database but in the storage system. When a document is deleted using one of the delete-calls, the database entries for the deleted documents (including those of older versions) are removed. A system job will delete the content elements of the deleted documents from the storage system asynchronously. To delete both the database entries and all content elements (including those referenced from older versions) immediately, a client can use the purge methods provided by the document client API. The purge methods will first remove the content elements from the storage and then remove the database entries. In case some content elements could not be removed from the storage, the system job mentioned above will try to remove those content elements asynchronously. The IDs of the content elements that need to be removed from the storage in the asynchronous mode are kept in a system table (ecr_purge_content_elements) until they have been deleted successfully. When a content element could not be deleted, the entry in the system table is marked as failed. The number of entries in the system table can be monitored using the actuator endpoint contentElementPurgeTable. The entries marked as failed in the system table can then be used to resolve the problem manually. The system job that deletes the content from the storage must run in the internal job scheduler of the Repository Service. A type definition can use the optional recycle bin feature. If it is enabled, entities in the type definition can be moved to and restored from the recycle bin. The Delete-API allows you to execute the methods: MoveToRecycleBin(): to move an object to the recycle bin. The DELETE-property of the latest version is set to 1 and content and older versions are not affected. Delete() all the versions of the object are deleted from the database. Content is removed asynchronously. Purge(): all the versions of the objects are deleted from the database and the content objects or files are erased immediately. RestoreFormRecycleBin(): restore an object from the recycle bin, the DELETE-property is set to 0 If an object has relations to other objects the delete or purge method will fail with a foreign key exception. The Relation API provides methods to delete the relations (Remove Relations) Entities in the recycle bin will be filtered from normal queries by default, but a client can compose search expressions that override this behavior. To do that it is sufficient to include a reference to the deleted system field in the expression. The following example shows a part of a query that will show only deleted entities: Excerpt of an example query ....and().systemField(SystemFieldList.GeneralSystemField.Deleted.INSTANCE).equalTo().value(true) Note that the deleted system field can contain null values, which have the same meaning as false. When a client uses one of the delete calls to delete one or more entities, all database entries for those entities will be deleted (including all versions). There is no option to restore entities once they have been deleted. If there are relations between entities that are to be deleted, the relations are not deleted. Instead, a ForeignKeyException is thrown - and has to be handled by the caller. To delete all relations that originate from a certain entity, the method removeAllRelations() has to be used. The method returns the deleted relations: List<Relation> removed = sourceContainerClient.removeAllRelations(); You can also delete all relations that point to a specific entity. For this, there is the method removeAllIncomingRelations(). This also returns the deleted relations: List<Relation> removed = targetContainerClient.removeAllIncomingRelations(); Once all relations have been removed, the entity can also be deleted.","title":"Delete an object","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"repo-service-delete-objects","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/repo-service-delete-objects.html","titles":[{"text":"Filtering the recycle bin","hash":"filtering_the_recycle_bin","id":1},{"text":"Removing all relations of an entity","hash":"removing_all_relations_of_an_entity","id":2}]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"Content, annotations and metadata of a document can be downloaded via API.

The arveo service provides a special HTTP endpoint to process download links. This endpoint does not require authentication.

Each content element is named. As a result, you get a globally unique ID (DocumentID), which can be used to reference content, annotations and / or just metadata of the latest version of the document. It is possible to clone content elements from one document to another, creating a copy of the content on the storage. For that, a ContentReference can be supplied when the document is created. Example: Upload a document with new content TypedDocumentServiceClient<SingleContentDocument> serviceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(SingleContentDocument.class); (1) SingleContentDocument document = serviceClient.createTypeInstance(); document.setName(\"name\"); ByteArrayInputStream data = new ByteArrayInputStream(\"abcde\".getBytes()); (2) Map<String, ContentUpload> content = Map.of(\"content\", new ContentUpload(data)); (3) TypedDocumentClient<SingleContentDocument> client = serviceClient.create(new TypedDocumentInput<>(content, document)); 1 The typeDefinitionServiceClient is an instance of TypeDefinitionServiceClient, that can be injected. 2 The actual content is passed as an InputStream. 3 The type definition SingleContentDocument uses only the default content definition, hence the default name is used. Example: Upload a document with cloned content TypedDocumentServiceClient<TypedTargetDocument> serviceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(TypedTargetDocument.class); (1) TypedTargetDocument document = serviceClient.createTypeInstance(); DocumentContentReference reference = new DocumentContentReference(documentId, \"s3stuff\"); (2) TypedDocumentClient<TypedTargetDocument> client = serviceClient.create(new TypedDocumentInput<>(document, Map.of(\"content\", reference))); 1 The typeDefinitionServiceClient is an instance of TypeDefinitionServiceClient, that can be injected. 2 Here the documentId is the ID of an already existing document that uses the default content definition. Example: Upload a document with Base64 encoded data Base64EncodedData data = new Base64EncodedData(base64Data);(1) Map<String, ContentUpload> contentElements = Map.of(\"content\", new ContentUpload(data));(2) serviceClient.create(new TypedDocumentInput<>(contentElements, document));(3) 1 Wrap the Base64 encoded data in a new Base64EncodedData instance 2 Create a content upload with the created Base64EncodedData 3 Upload the document There are several different ways to validate the content of an uploaded document. The method to use depends on the requirements of the client application. Some applications might already have computed a hash of the content while others might offload this to the server. When content is uploaded to a type definition that supports content metadata, the server computes an SHA-256 hash for the received data and returns it in the result of the upload request. The client can use this hash value to compare the data received by the server with the original data. The following example shows how to compare the hash values: Example: Checking hash values on the client side ContentTest entity = client.create(input).getEntity(); (1) Hash hash = entity.getContent().get(\"content\").getHash(); (2) Hash expectedHash = Hash.sha256Hash(inputStream, 1000000, tempFile); (3) Assert.assertEquals(expectedHash, hash); 1 The document is uploaded using a type definition service client 2 Get the hash returned from the server. getContent is a getter for the system property SystemPropertyName.CONTENT. 3 Use de.eitco.ecr.common.Hash to compute the expected hash The TypedDocumentServiceClient offers an additional method to validate uploaded content. The createAndValidate method automatically computes a hash of the uploaded data and compares it with the hash value returned from the server. If the two hashes do not match, a HashValidationException is thrown and the created document will be purged. Example: Using the createAndValidate method TypedDocumentServiceClient<ContentTest> client = typeDefinitionServiceClient .getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(ContentTest.class); ContentUpload contentUpload = new ContentUpload(data); Map<String, ContentUpload> content = Map.of(\"content\", contentUpload); ContentTest instance = client.createTypeInstance(); TypedDocumentInput<ContentTest> input = new TypedDocumentInput<>(content, instance); client.createAndValidate(input); It is also possible to pass a hex representation of an SHA-256 hash code of the uploaded content to the server. If such a hash is present, the server will compare the computed hash value with the one specified by the client. If the values do not match, the upload fails and the uploaded file will not be stored. Example: Checking hash values on the server side Hash hash = Hash.sha256Hash(inputStream, 1000000, tempFile); (1) ContentUpload contentUpload = new ContentUpload( \"lorem_ipsum.txt\", (2) null, (3) null, (4) data, hash ); Map<String, ContentUpload> content = Map.of(\"content\", contentUpload); ContentTest document = client.createTypeInstance(); TypedDocumentInput<ContentTest> input = new TypedDocumentInput<>(content, document); client.create(input); 1 Use de.eitco.ecr.common.Hash to compute the hash 2 The filename 3 null for the length, will be computed by the server 4 null for the content type, will be computed by the server The TypedDocumentServiceClient provides a method called hashMatches that can be used to check if the content of an existing document is valid. The client has to provide the expected hash, the document’s ID and the name of the content element to check. An additional parameter called loadContent defines if the server should use the hash value stored in the database or if it should load the content from the storage and compute a new hash value to compare. It is possible to check the content of a specific version of a document, too. Example: Checking hash values of an existing document Hash hash = Hash.sha256Hash(inputStream, 1000000, tempFile); boolean hashMatches = documentServiceClient.hashMatches(documentId, \"content\", hash, false); In some situations uploading large files might fail because of timeouts or an unstable network connection. For these situations, arveo supports resumable uploads using the tus protocol. On the server side, an additional service is used that provides the tus API and stores uploaded files in the filesystem. The Content Repository Service retrieves uploaded files from the upload service and stores them just as any regular content. When the content was stored successfully, the uploaded file is deleted from the upload service’s storage automatically. In case storing the content in the Content Repository Service has failed, the uploaded file is not removed, giving the client the opportunity to re-try storing the content without having to upload the entire file again. The following example shows how to use the tus client in combination with the arveo SDK to use resumable uploads. The tus client can be obtained using the following dependency: <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.commons</groupId> <artifactId>tus-upload-service-client-spring</artifactId> <version>${tus-upload-service.version}</version> </dependency> Example: Resumable uploads File file = new File(baseDirectory + \"/src/test/resources/documents/lorem_ipsum.txt\"); String uploadId; try (TusClient tusClient = tusClientFactory.newClient()) { (1) TusUpload upload = new TusUpload(new FileInputStream(file), \"lorem-ipsum.txt\", file.length()); uploadId = tusClient.resumeOrCreateUpload(upload, 100 * 1024); (2) } TypedDocumentServiceClient<Files> serviceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(Files.class); Files document = serviceClient.createTypeInstance(); document.setFilename(\"lorem_ipsum.txt\"); AsyncUploadReference uploadReference = new AsyncUploadReference(uploadId, \"lorem_ipsum.txt\"); (3) Map<String, ContentReference> contentReferences = Map.of(\"content\", uploadReference); TypedDocumentClient<Files> typedDocumentClient = serviceClient.create(new TypedDocumentInput<>(document, contentReferences)); 1 Create a new TusClient using the injectable TusClientFactory. 2 Remember the unique ID of the upload. 3 Reference the uploaded file using its ID for the document creation call for the Content Repository Service.","title":"Uploading data","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"repo-service-upload-data","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/repo-service-upload-data.html","titles":[{"text":"Validating uploaded content","hash":"validating_uploaded_content","id":1},{"text":"Validating content on the client side","hash":"validating_content_on_the_client_side","id":2},{"text":"Validating content on the server side","hash":"validating_content_on_the_server_side","id":3},{"text":"Validating the content of an existing document","hash":"validating_the_content_of_an_existing_document","id":4},{"text":"Resumable uploads","hash":"resumable_uploads","id":5}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"The Repository Service service is responsible for handling various repository entities such as documents and folders.

While it is recommended to use one of the SDKs, in some situations it might be required to access the RESTful API directly. This chapter provides information about the JSON serialization of the models and examples for some important requests. arveo uses a custom serialization for the JSON data in the RESTful API to support advanced features like polymorphism. Additionally, the custom serialization allows the arveo server and the client SDKs to pass type information. This way it is for example possible to differ between number types like short, int and long. The client SDKs take care of the serialization and the direct usage of the RESTful API is discouraged. The service offers an overview page containing the REST resources and details about the models. It can generate examples for the models, too. The overview page is located at the root URL of the service. The overview page also contains an OpenAPI specification for the Content Repository Service. Note that the Swagger UI used in the overview page has some limitations. For example, it does not support the multipart/form-data requests used to upload new documents. Each object contains a type identifier in a json property called @type. The required value is listed in the API overview page for each model class. Example: \"identifier\": { \"@type\": \"container-id\", \"identifier\": { \"@long\": \"1\" } } There are some special type identifiers used to identify the type of JSON fields. The following table lists types and their corresponding identifiers. Types in Java and their Identifiers in arveo Type (Java) Identifier Byte @byte Short @short Long @long BigInteger @big-int Float @float ZonedDateTime @zoned-date-time LocalDateTime @local-date-time Class<?> @type-reference UUID @uuid byte[] @binary LocalDate @date LocalTime @time Other data types do not require specific type identifiers. The API supports different date and time types based on the respective Java representations: LocalDate: Contains only date information without time and timezone. LocalTime: Contains only time information without timezone. ZonedDateTime: Contains date and time information including a time zone. LocalDateTime: Contains date and time information without a time zone. ZonedDateTime values are represented as a string in ISO8601 format. \"@zoned-date-time\": \"2025-04-08T15:16:20.027Z\" LocalDateTime values are represented as a string in ISO8601 format without timezone. \"@local-date-time\": \"2025-04-08T15:16:20.027\" LocalDate values are represented as an object containing year, month and day of month. \"@localDate\": { \"year\": 2025, \"month\": 4, \"day\": 8 } LocalTime values are represented as an object containing hour, minute, second and nano. \"@time\": { \"hour\": 17, \"minute\": 48, \"second\": 23, \"nano\": 0 } To distinguish between different types of collections (lists and sets) there are type identifiers for collection types. Identifiers for the Types List and Set Type (Java) Identifier List @list Set @set The following is an example of the Type List: \"list\": { \"@list\": [] } The arveo Content Repository Service supports OAuth2 and x509 authorization protocols. x509 requires the client to encrypt requests with a trusted certificate. OAuth2 uses access tokens, which must be sent in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. The examples below all use OAuth2. There are several different methods (or flows) to acquire an access token from an IDP like Keycloak. Details about the different token requests can be found in the IDPs documentation. The following examples show some often used request types. This example creates a new container entity. Containers contain attributes but no binary content. Hence, a simple POST request with a JSON payload is used. creating a new container POST http://localhost:39001/api/containers/multiple/date_time_thing HTTP/1.1 Authorization: Bearer {{$auth.token(\"keycloak\")}} Content-Type: application/json { \"@type\": \"create-containers-input\", \"inputs\": { \"@list\": [ { \"@type\": \"container-input\", \"attributes\": { \"date\": { \"@date\": { \"year\": 2025, \"month\": 4, \"day\": 8 } }, \"time\": { \"@time\": { \"hour\": 17, \"minute\": 48, \"second\": 23, \"nano\": 0 } }, \"date_time\": { \"@zoned-date-time\": \"2025-04-08T15:16:20.027Z\" }, \"other_date_time\": { \"@local-date-time\": \"2025-04-08T15:16:20.027\" } } } ] } } The request creates a single container. Creating multiple containers in a single request is possible because the outer create-containers-input object contains a list of individual container-input objects. The type definition of the containers is defined in the last part of the URL (date-time-thing). The string {{$auth.token(\"keycloak\")}} is a placeholder for the actual access token. Document entities contain both attributes and binary content. Multipart requests are used to transfer both in a single request to the server. using a multipart request to create a new document POST http://localhost:39001/api/documents/simple_invoice/multiple HTTP/1.1 Authorization: Bearer {{$auth.token(\"keycloak\")}} Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---randomboundary918273 -----randomboundary918273 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"batchInput\"; filename=\"batchInput\" Content-Type: application/json { \"@type\": \"create-documents-input\", \"inputs\": { \"@list\": [ { \"@type\": \"document-input\", \"contentReferences\": {}, \"content\": { \"content\": { \"@type\": \"content-upload\", \"data\": { \"@stream-id\": \"stream1\" } } }, \"attributes\": { \"invoice_number\": \"20250001\", \"amount\": 19.99 } } ] } } -----randomboundary918273 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"stream1\"; filename=\"test.txt\" Content-Type: text/plain This is my text file. -----randomboundary918273-- The request consists of two parts.

All entities with a retention period that has expired before the specified time will be removed. The specified time must be in the past.

A separate system job will then remove the content elements from the storage. If removing of at least one content element of a version had failed, the entry in the system table will be marked as failed. When all content elements were removed successfully, the entry will be removed. The purge method on the other hand will first try to remove all content elements of the document versions from the storage, then it will delete the database entries. In case a content element could not be removed from the storage, it is added to the above-mentioned system table. When it could not be removed by the system job, too, it will be marked as failed.

If some of your documents could be required in a legal proceeding but the retention period expires before the end of dispute you can set a litigation hold or prolong the retention period to protect the data until the dispute has finished. Let us describe why the storage container concept is used by arveo. Most storage systems can create objects much faster than they can delete them. Once the retention has expired it is much faster to remove a bucket (cloud storage) or partition/directory (file system). You can setup retention rules to define which documents are stored to the containers. All documents within a certain retention range (e.g. 1 year or 3 months) will be stored to one storage container (S3 bucket or directory). arveo allows you to delete millions of content objects in a very short time by simply removing the entire storage container. If a document needs to be deleted e.g. for data privacy reasons, arveo also provides an API call to erase single objects by their ID. If you want to delete an object before its retention period has expired the user needs along with delete_right also the dataprivacy_admin privilege. Because the new legal data privacy / protection act makes it necessary to erase data even before the expected retention period has expired arveo does not use hardware retention features, which protect data from erasure on the hardware level. arveo protects the content by software design. arveo stores the retention information in the database and only allows access to the content and metadata by the arveo REST API. The REST API prevents any delete operation before the retention period has expired. As only arveo and highly authorized administrators have data writer rights for the database and the storage it is impossible that content be deleted or manipulated before the retention expires. The operator must take appropriate technical or organizational measures to ensure that the data is stored in the storage in such a way that it cannot be changed within the legally prescribed retention period. The provider of the arveo services should ensure that only authorized data protection officers & administrators have data write (INSERT,UPDTAE; DELETE) permissions for the database and the content repository. Since deleting large amounts of documents is a performance critical task, the arveo repository service provides special support for mass deletion of documents whose retention period has expired. The basic idea is to define separate storage locations, which are exclusively used to store documents with similar retention requirements. The deletion of documents with specific retention requirements is then a matter of deleting all contents of a specific storage location in one step. Storage locations containing documents with the same retention period will be called storage container for the rest of this section. arveo allows you to store data with the same retention in one storage container and is able to create storage containers automatically. The storage containers are either folders (file system storage) or buckets (S3 object storage). The actual selection of the storage container for a document with specific retention requirements can be configured by rules, that select the storage container based on the retention period and litigation hold status of the uploaded document. When the litigation hold is set, the object is moved to the litigation hold directory or bucket and will not be deleted when the initial retention period expires. When the litigation hold ends, the document is deleted the next time a delete job runs. The number of objects under litigation hold is typically small and does not affect the overall erasure performance. When a litigation hold is removed, the objects are moved to other storage container which do not have a litigationHold on them. The following diagram shows the life cycle of a document with a fixed retention period set on upload, a legal dispute and automatic erasure at the end of the document’s life cycle: Figure 1. Retention in buckets Each storage container in fact corresponds to a separate storage profile that is used to store the contents of that storage container. The rules that are used to map the retention requirements of documents to storage container are defined as rules for the Bucket Organizer Plugin, see Bucketorganizer. arveo provides a system property LITIGATION_HOLD that allows you to prolong the retention until you remove the litigation hold property. This function requires the ECR_DSGVO_ADMIN privilege. You can prolong the retention period but not shorten it. You can use the API call to set the initial retention period if the retention is null. When the retention is prolonged, arveo moves the object to the appropriate storage container. This function requires the ECR_DSGVO_ADMIN privilege. The arveo delete API will as for all other objects without a retention period delete the respective objects. See also Deletion of objects and Recovery table. After the retention period has expired, the function requires the DELETE privilege, but before the retention period has expired, ECR_DSGVO_PRIVILEGED_DELETE privilege is required. This API should not be used for operations like deleting the objects of a certain year. This should be done using the erasure storage container API. If you have used the storage container feature to speed up the deletion of documents at the end of their life cycle, you can delete all documents within a retention period range with one API REST call 'EraseStorageContainer'. You can either erase the storage container (buckets, folders) controlled by your operating team or with an automated arveo job. You can set up a scheduled job in the arveo integration service. Use the erasure storage container template job and adopt it to your needs. The erasure job will delete all entities of a document type within the given retention period range where litigation hold is not set. The job will write an entry for each erased object in the corresponding audit log table. For more detailed explanation, see the erasure job template example. Mass deletion of documents under retention requires the SUPER_USER privilege. Enable the audit log feature for all document types and dependent document types if you need a report of the erased objects. Audit Log Grant the deletion right for your storage containers to arveo. If arveo cannot delete the containers, your operating team is in charge of this task and you must set the option delete rows only.

The SDK can be used both to access the arveo via HTTP and to use the arveo as an embedded library. Maven dependency of the Client SDK for usage via HTTP <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-sdk-http</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> </dependency> Maven dependency of the Client SDK for embedded usage <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-embedded</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> </dependency> The SDK offers both a generic API, where attributes of objects are mapped as a generic map, and a typed API. The typed API uses classes to be created by the project that represent the objects with the attributes. The main entry point for the API is the class de.eitco.ecr.sdk.TypeDefinitionServiceClient. An instance of this class can be obtained using Spring Dependency Injection. With the methods getDocumentServiceClient() getContainerServiceClient() getFolderServiceClient() getRelationServiceClient() getMetaDataServiceClient() you obtain a client factory that can be used to create a service client for a specific type definition. This service client can then be used to create new objects or load existing objects. For created or loaded objects, one in turn receives an entity client that offers methods for accessing the object. Special version clients are also available for concrete versions of entities. The getting started guide contains an example that demonstrates how to use the typed API in a Spring application. The client SDK must be able to find an instance of the content repository service and it must authenticate requests it sends to the service instance. The SDK uses service discovery to find an instance of the content repository service. By default, the Eureka Service Registry is used for service discovery. Each service registers itself in Eureka, and clients (or other services) can retrieve a list of available instances from Eureka. When the Eureka Service Registry is not running on the same machine as the client application, it’s URL must be configured: Eureka Service URL eureka: client: serviceUrl: defaultZone: \"http://service-registry-host:8761/eureka/\" When more than one instance of a service is returned from the service registry, the clients automatically perform load balancing and failover. In scenarios where the Eureka Service Registry is not used (like Kubernetes), the available service instance(s) must be configured manually. manually configuring service instances eureka: client: enabled: false spring: cloud: discovery: client: simple: instances: content-repository-service: - uri: \"http://server1:12345\" - uri: \"http://server2:12345\" In Kubernetes installations only one instance of the Content Repository Service using the Kubernetes service name must be configured. Failover and load balancing is performed by Kubernetes. Alternatively, the Kubernetes Discovery Client can be enabled using spring.cloud.kubernetes.enabled=true. Note that additional RBAC privileges are required to use the Kubernetes Discovery Client. The service uses OAuth2 to authenticate requests. A client application must retrieve a token from the IDP and send it as a bearer token in the Authentication header of each request. The client SDK automatically retrieves tokens from the IDP. It also automatically refreshes expired tokens. To be able to retrieve tokens from the IDP, the SDK must either authenticate using a username and password or using a client secret. Both ways are configured as shown below: OAuth2 configuration (username and password) spring: security: oauth2: client: registration: keycloak-password: provider: keycloak client-id: \"your-client-id\" client-secret: \"your-client-secret\" authorization-grant-type: \"password\" scope: openid provider: keycloak: issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:${keycloak.port}/realms/TestRealm\" The client secret can be omitted for public clients. The actual username and password are set in the application code as shown in the getting started guide. OAuth2 configuration (client secret) spring: security: oauth2: client: registration: keycloak-secret: provider: keycloak client-id: \"your-client-id\" client-secret: \"your-client-secret\" authorization-grant-type: \"client_credentials\" provider: keycloak: issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:${keycloak.port}/realms/TestRealm\" The SDK can be used both in applications that provide web functionality like REST endpoints and in applications that do not contain any web functionality. For non-web applications, some differences need to be considered. By default, the SDK contains an OAuth2 client implementation that relies on some web-related spring beans. For non-web applications, a different OAuth2 client implementation is available. The default implementation needs to be excluded from the SDK dependency and replaced by the non-web implementation as shown in the following example: <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-sdk-http</artifactId> <version>${ecr.version}</version> <exclusions> <exclusion> <groupId>de.eitco.commons</groupId> <artifactId>cmn-spring-security5-oauth2-client</artifactId> </exclusion> </exclusions> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.commons</groupId> <artifactId>cmn-spring-security5-oauth2-client-non-web</artifactId> <version>${commons-oauth2-version}</version> </dependency> The current version of the OAuth2 client can be found in the Nexus. The SDK contains some dependencies that cause Spring to initialize some web functionality automatically. This can cause problems like missing spring security configuration errors. Non-web applications can simply turn off all of Springs web functionality by using the SpringApplicationBuilder class as shown in the following example: @SpringBootApplication public class MyApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { new SpringApplicationBuilder(MyApplication.class) .web(WebApplicationType.NONE) .run(args); } } The SDK provides various methods for batch operations. For example, several objects can be created or updated at once. All service clients provide methods for creating, updating and deleting multiple objects. Since a service client is bound to a specific type definition, only objects of the same type can be created, updated or deleted in this way. The objects to be updated or deleted are identified by any selector. When updating, methods are available that return the updated objects and methods that return only the number of updated objects. Especially if a large number of objects are updated at once, only the latter methods should be used. With these methods, the objects can only be updated in the same way. If the objects are to be customised, the methods from the BatchOperationServiceClient (see below) must be used. The BatchOperationServiceClient class provides methods to create or update multiple objects of different types. To create multiple objects of different types, special BatchCreateInput input objects are used that bundle the type of the object and its properties. The order in which the objects are created corresponds to the order in which the input objects are passed. Each of these input objects contains a virtual ID that identifies it within the batch operation. In this way, for example, a relation as well as its source and target can be created in a batch operation. The relation only has to be created with the virtual IDs of source and target. If the relation between the objects consists not only of the ID, but also of a foreign key to any attribute, a reference to the corresponding attribute of the referenced object must be given to the dependent object. For this purpose, the class BatchAttributeReference is available, which bundles the name of the foreign key attribute, the referenced attribute and the virtual ID of the other object in the batch operation. Code examples can be found in the class de.eitco.ecr.system.test.batch.BatchCreationIT. The BatchOperationServiceClient also provides methods to update several different objects of different types in a batch operation. A separate input object is passed for each object to be updated, which contains the ID of the object and the properties to be updated. This means that individual changes can also be made to each object with these methods. The BatchUpdateUtility class provides auxiliary methods with which the respective input objects can be created. Code examples can be found in the class de.eitco.ecr.system.test.batch.BatchUpdateIT. The BatchCreateInput objects used to create various types make it possible to automatically update the existing object in the event of a collision. To do this, the BatchCreateInput only has to be made aware of the field on which the collision could occur: TypedContainerBatchCreateInput<Person> containerBatchCreateInput = new TypedContainerBatchCreateInput<>(new TypedContainerInput<>(person), List.of()); containerBatchCreateInput.setCollisionCheckAttribute(\"first_name\"); In the above example, a container is to be created in a batch where a collision could possibly occur on the attribute first_name. The attribute that is to be used to detect the collisions must be provided with a unique constraint. The SDK provides methods to perform create or update (upsert) operations on entities.The entity to update, if it should exist, is identified by an EQL selector. If a matching entity is found, it is updated using the provided data. If no matching entity is found, the provided data is used to create a new entity. The selector must match exactly one or zero existing entities. If it matches more than one entity, an exception is thrown. The following example shows how to perform an upsert operation. Performing an upsert operation TypedContainerServiceClient<Person> serviceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient.getContainerServiceClient().byClass(Person.class); LocalDate birthday = LocalDate.of(1995, Month.SEPTEMBER, 16); Person person = serviceClient.createTypeInstance(); person.setBirthday(birthday); person.setSurname(\"Smith\"); person.setFirstName(\"John\"); person.setBreakTime(LocalTime.NOON); person.setProcedureDate(ZonedDateTime.now()); TypedContainerClient<Person> client = serviceClient.createOrUpdate( EcrQueryLanguage.condition().entity().field(PersonNames.FIRST_NAME).equalTo().value(\"John\").holds(), (1) person, Set.of(PersonNames.PROCEDURE_DATE) (2) ); 1 The selector that uniquely identifies the entity to update 2 (Optional) names of attributes that will not be updated in case the entity already exists. All other attributes (excluding read only attributes) will be updated. The documentation for foreign keys contains an example for how to use the batch operations to perform an upsert and a create operation in one transaction. The generic batch operation API can be used to perform different operations like create, update or delete in one transaction. The batch operations use the same input types as the other batch functions described above, which makes it possible to use the result of one operation in another following operation. The following operation types are available: TypedContainerBatchReadOperation TypedDocumentBatchReadOperation TypedFolderBatchReadOperation TypedMetaDataBatchReadOperation TypedRelationDataBatchReadOperation The purpose of read operations is to provide input data for other operations. For example, a read operation could be used to read an entity of which only the ID is known, and then use the entity’s attribute values as input for a create operation. When the entity cannot be read, the entire batch of operations fails and the transaction is rolled back. TypedContainerBatchDeleteOperation TypedDocumentBatchDeleteOperation TypedFolderBatchDeleteOperation TypedMetaDataBatchDeleteOperation TypedRelationBatchDeleteOperation Delete operations are used to delete a single entity. Unlike the other operations, it is not possible to reference a delete operation. When the entity cannot be deleted, the entire batch of operations fails and the transaction is rolled back. TypedContainerBatchUpdateOperation TypedDocumentBatchUpdateOperation TypedFolderBatchUpdateOperation TypedMetaDataBatchUpdateOperation TypedRelationBatchUpdateOperation Update operations are used to update a single entity. When the entity cannot be updated, the entire batch of operations fails and the transaction is rolled back. TypedContainerBatchCreateOrUpdateOperation TypedDocumentBatchCreateOrUpdateOperation TypedFolderBatchCreateOrUpdateOperation TypedMetaDataBatchCreateOrUpdateOperation TypedRelationBatchCreateOrUpdateOperation Create or update operations perform an upsert as described in Create or update (upsert) operations. When the operation cannot update or create the entity, the entire batch of operations fails and the transaction is rolled back. TypedContainerBatchCreateOperation TypedDocumentBatchCreateOperation TypedFolderBatchCreateOperation TypedMetaDataBatchCreateOperation TypedRelationBatchCreateOperation Create operations are used to create a new entity. When the entity cannot be created, the entire batch of operations fails and the transaction is rolled back. The first example implements a solution for the following problem: An invoice was archived with a relation to an invalid customer. The customer must be replaced with a new customer and the reference in the invoice must be updated. Using the generic batch api for crud operations Customer customer = customerServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); customer.setName(UUID.randomUUID().toString()); TypedDocumentBatchCreateOperation<Customer> createCustomerOperation = (1) new TypedDocumentBatchCreateOperation<>(customer); Invoice invoice = invoiceServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); BatchAttributeReference reference = new BatchAttributeReference( (2) InvoiceNames.CUSTOMER_NUMBER, SystemFieldList.GeneralSystemField.Id.INSTANCE.getName(), createCustomerOperation.getVirtualId().getUuid() ); TypedDocumentBatchUpdateInput<Invoice> invoiceInput = new TypedDocumentBatchUpdateInput<>(invoiceId, new TypedDocumentInput<>(invoice), List.of(reference)); TypedDocumentBatchUpdateOperation<Invoice> updateInvoiceOperation = (3) new TypedDocumentBatchUpdateOperation<>(invoiceInput); TypedDocumentBatchDeleteOperation deleteCustomerOperation = new TypedDocumentBatchDeleteOperation(customerId); (4) List<EcrId> ids = batchOperationServiceClient.performTypedBatchOperations( (5) createCustomerOperation, updateInvoiceOperation, deleteCustomerOperation); 1 The operation to create the new customer 2 A reference to the ID of the new customer to be used for the customer_number field of the updated invoice 3 The operation to update the existing invoice 4 The operation to delete the invalid customer 5 An injected instance of de.eitco.ecr.sdk.BatchOperationServiceClient The second example shows how to use a read operation. Using a read operation TypedDocumentBatchReadOperation readCustomerOperation = new TypedDocumentBatchReadOperation(customerId); Invoice invoice = invoiceServiceClient.createTypeInstance(); invoice.setCustomerNumber(customerId.getIdentifier()); BatchAttributeReference attributeReference = new BatchAttributeReference( (1) InvoiceNames.CUSTOMER_NAME, CustomerNames.NAME, readCustomerOperation.getVirtualId().getUuid() ); TypedDocumentBatchCreateInput<Invoice> invoiceInput = new TypedDocumentBatchCreateInput<>(new TypedDocumentInput<>(invoice), List.of(attributeReference)); TypedDocumentBatchCreateOperation<Invoice> createInvoiceOperation = new TypedDocumentBatchCreateOperation<>(invoiceInput); List<EcrId> ids = batchOperationServiceClient.performTypedBatchOperations(readCustomerOperation, createInvoiceOperation); (2) 1 A reference to the name attribute of the customer read by the read operation used for the customer_name attribute of the invoice 2 An injected instance of de.eitco.ecr.sdk.BatchOperationServiceClient","title":"Java SDK for Spring applications","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"sdk-and-batch-operations","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/sdk-and-batch-operations.html","titles":[{"text":"Accessing the content repository service","hash":"accessing_the_content_repository_service","id":1},{"text":"Service discovery","hash":"service_discovery","id":2},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"authentication","id":3},{"text":"Using the SDK in a non-web application","hash":"using_the_sdk_in_a_non_web_application","id":4},{"text":"Dependencies","hash":"dependencies","id":5},{"text":"Application initialization","hash":"application_initialization","id":6},{"text":"Batch Operations","hash":"batch_operations","id":7},{"text":"Create, update or delete multiple objects of the same type","hash":"create_update_or_delete_multiple_objects_of_the_same_type","id":8},{"text":"Create or update several objects of different types","hash":"create_or_update_several_objects_of_different_types","id":9},{"text":"Create several interdependent objects","hash":"create_several_interdependent_objects","id":10},{"text":"Update multiple objects of different types","hash":"update_multiple_objects_of_different_types","id":11},{"text":"Automatic update in case of collision","hash":"automatic_update_in_case_of_collision","id":12},{"text":"Create or update (upsert) operations","hash":"_create_or_update_upsert_operations","id":13},{"text":"Generic batch operations","hash":"generic_batch_operations","id":14},{"text":"Read operations","hash":"read_operations","id":15},{"text":"Delete operations","hash":"delete_operations","id":16},{"text":"Update operations","hash":"update_operations","id":17},{"text":"Create or update operations","hash":"create_or_update_operations","id":18},{"text":"Create operations","hash":"create_operations","id":19},{"text":"Examples","hash":"examples","id":20}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"Any client application, that needs a search function, can implement the Search Service with a suitable parameter. An example of such an implementation is the class DocumentServiceClient in the Client API. The search queries are formulated similarly, what is different is the search result, which is always typed. In arveo the type is Entity. Search Service is part of the module 'commons'. It was created to enable more convenient searching. The Search Service works on the basis of EQL (Eitco Query Language). This query language is also used for some other services. The main interface is SearchService. It is a functional interface, providing just one method to be implemented: search(). However, this functional interface has a variety of convenience methods, enabling faster and more convenient search, like firstResult(), uniqueResult(), count(), stream() and others. Listing for the search method definition Page<EntityType> search(@NotNull SearchRequest searchRequest); As the only parameter, a search request is accepted, returning a Page of results. A Page has a page definition, a completeCount and a parameterized list of results. The Search Service also provides a method where() with a condition builder, filtering results based on a specific condition. SearchServiceFactory is a server class, which builds search queries. It has methods for creating an instance of search service for Documents (searchServiceForDocument()), but also for all the other entities, including Metadata. The result of the search is transformed into a Document (or respectively another entity) by the DocumentMapper. The class SearchResourceImplementation provides an API for searches that are not bound to one and only one type definition. The interface SearchService is implemented by the class EcrSearchService. The search client creates different search services, which can be used to search for corresponding entities, for instance a folder search service, a document search service and so on. And there is also a GenericUnionSearchService, that can be used to create any joins on search statements. The following examples demonstrates the usage of the Search Service to retrieve an object page. Example of Search Service usage SearchService<Object> searchService = <a valid instance>; Page<Object> objectPage = searchService.where() .contextReference(\"field\").equalTo().value(7).or() .contextReference(\"other_field\").greaterEqual().contextReference(\"another_field\") .holds() .order().descendingBy(\"field\").from(5).pageSize(7); It is possible to check the type of object searched for: Example for type checking searchService.where() (1) .entity().typeId() (2) .equalTo() .typeId(NamedFile.class) (3) .or() .entity().typeName() (4) .in().expressions(x -> x .typeName(NamedTextFile.class) (5) .typeName(NamedFolder.class) ).and() .entity().typeId().notEqual().typeId(\"named_relation\") (6) 1 The variable searchService is an EcrSearchService. 2 The id of the type of given entity is referenced by the method typeId(). 3 The type id is checked to be the id of the type defined by the class NamedFile (which is obtained by the method typeId()). 4 Here the type name is referenced instead of the type id. 5 As with the type id, the name of the type defined by the class NamedTextFile is obtained. 6 The type id can also be obtained if only the type name is given. Using the ecr sdk you will be able to obtain a SearchClient by spring injection. Injecting a search client @Autowired private SearchClient searchClient; A search client has several methods to search in different ways or different contexts. A powerful search end-point is the union search. It searches entities that are part of unions of different joins. For example, consider the following types: union search example types @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface DocumentA { @ForeignKey(target = ContainerA.class, targetProperty = \"id\") Long getContainer(); (1) String getProperty1(); (2) String getProperty3(); (4) String getProperty4(); (5) String getProperty7(); (7) } @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface ContainerA { String getProperty1(); (2) String getProperty2(); (3) String getProperty4(); (5) } @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface DocumentB { @ForeignKey(target = ContainerB.class, targetProperty = \"id\") Long getContainer(); (1) Integer getProperty1(); (2) String getProperty3(); (4) String getProperty4(); (5) String getProperty5(); (6) } @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) public interface ContainerB { String getProperty1(); (2) String getProperty2(); (3) String getProperty4(); (5) String getProperty7(); (7) } note that: 1 These are two pairs of types that are each related to each other by a foreign key in the Document type both using the property container. 2 Every type has a property named property1, however in DocumentB its type is Integer while in the other types it is String. 3 Only the container types have a property named property2, in both cases of type String 4 Only the document types have a property named property3, also both of type String 5 All types have a property named property4 in all cases it is of type String 6 Only the type DocumentB has a property property5 7 Only the types ContainerB and DocumentA contain the property property7 Now, using the SearchClient.genericUnionSearch() method, it is possible to search on a union like the following: sql equivalent of a union search document_a as document left join container_a as container on document.container = container.id union all document_b as document left join container_b as container on document.container = container.id the sql query arveo will actually generate will be more complex. We stick to a simpler variant here for ease of understanding. This is done as follows: corresponding union search service Alias DOCUMENT = Alias.byName(\"document\"); Alias CONTAINER = Alias.byName(\"container\"); EcrSearchService<JoinedEntities<Object>> unionSearchService = searchClient. (1) genericUnionSearch() (2) .type(DocumentA.class).as(DOCUMENT).leftJoin().type(ContainerA.class).as(CONTAINER) (3) .on().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"container\").equalTo().alias(CONTAINER).id().holds() (4) .unionAll() (5) .type(DocumentB.class).as(DOCUMENT).leftJoin().type(ContainerB.class).as(CONTAINER) (6) .on().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"container\").equalTo().alias(CONTAINER).id().holds() .build(); 1 assume we have a search client already injected (see above) 2 using the method genericUnionSearch …​ 3 …​ we can define a left join between DocumentA and ContainerA …​ 4 …​ using the foreign key of the field container as join condition. 5 This join can now be unified with another join. 6 The other join being a left join between DocumentB and ContainerB with basically the same join condition. Note that both joins use the same aliases for the document type and the container type respectively. Now the unionSearchService can be used to search elements of the defined union: A simple search on the union Stream<JoinedEntities<Object>> stream = unionSearchService. (1) all().order(). (2) stream(200); (3) 1 Using the union search service …​ 2 …​ we can now obtain every element of this union in no specified order …​ 3 …​ as stream that will page with a size of 200 elements. the resulting stream will contain up to 200 elements. If the search resulted in more elements, the stream will invoke a search call transparently each 200 elements. The size of these pages can - of course - be specified by the parameter to the stream() method seen above. Since we used analogous aliases in the different elements of the union we can filter on the common elements of the types: A simple filtered search unionSearchService.where() .alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property4\").equalTo().value(\"target\") .or() .alias(CONTAINER).field(\"property4\").equalTo().value(\"target\") .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); This call would result in a stream containing all joined elements of the union where the document types or the container types property property4 has the value target We do not need to filter on properties of both types of a join. Consider the following query: A simple filtered search unionSearchService.where() .alias(CONTAINER).field(\"property2\").equalTo().value(\"target\") .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); This query will return a stream containing all the joined elements of the union where the container types property property2 has the value target. Keep in mind that these filters are working since we used the same aliases in both elements of the union. If we want to filter on properties however that are not part of every union element, there arise some difficulties. In that case, references to these properties will not be valid for every join. arveo solves these issues by preprocessing the search filter in the context of every element of the union being able to simplify some references. For example, the following query will not work: A query with a reference to a property that is not valid in every part of the union // will throw exception unionSearchService.where() .alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property5\") .equalTo().value(\"target\") .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); As seen earlier the property property5 is only defined on the type DocumentB. Because of that, the query above will throw an exception, since the filter cannot be applied to the first element of the join (where the DOCUMENT alias refers to DocumentA where this property is not defined). The query can be fixed in several ways. One can be to check the validity of the property inside the query using an is-null check and thus guarding the reference to the property: explicitly guarding a reference to a field unionSearchService.where() .not().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property5\").isNull() (1) .and().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property5\") .equalTo().value(\"target\") (2) .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); 1 Adding the further condition to the property to not be null (note the not() at the start of the line) …​ 2 …​ the reference to the field is explicitly guarded and will not throw an exception. How does that work? arveo will not simply add the given filter to the union query: naive sql query arveo does not generate select * from ( document_a as document left join container_a as container on document.container = container.id union all document_b as document left join container_b as container on document.container = container.id ) where <filter-condition> instead it will preprocess the filter in the context of every element of the union and add the resulting condition to their corresponding element of the union: conceptual sql query arveo actually generates select * from ( document_a as document left join container_a as container on document.container = container.id where <filter-condition preprocessed in the context of document_a join container_a> union all document_b as document left join container_b as container on document.container = container.id where <filter-condition preprocessed in the context of document_b join container_b> ) Specifically in the given example arveo can simplify the condition in the context of the first element as follows: not document.property5 is null and document.property5 = 'target' Since in the context of DocumentA the property does not exist, arveo can reduce this query to false and document.property5 = 'target' Since false and <any condition> always results in false this can be further simplified to false Note that this simple condition does not contain a reference to property5 and may thus be evaluated. In the context of the second element the condition cannot be simplified anymore. Since property5 does exist on DocumentB the property may not be null so the first part of the condition cannot be simplified. However the condition can be evaluated on this part of the union. Thus, it will result in a query like the following: simplified sql query select * from ( document_a as document left join container_a as container on document.container = container.id where false union all document_b as document left join container_b as container on document.container = container.id where not document.property5 is null and document.property5 = 'target' ) Since the condition simplified to false in the first case arveo will actually drop the first part of the union resulting in a query like that: even more simplified sql query select * from ( document_b as document left join container_b as container on document.container = container.id where not document.property5 is null and document.property5 = 'target' ) Now we can obviously see that the resulting query will never yield any result from the first part of the union. That may be the desired effect. However, should you want to have results from the first element of the union you can guard the context reference with an or operator, also: explicitly guarding a reference to a field using the or operator unionSearchService.where() .alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property5\").isNull() (1) .or().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property5\") .equalTo().value(\"target\") (2) .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); In this case arveo will simplify the query to simplified sql query guarding a reference using the or-operator select * from ( document_a as document left join container_a as container on document.container = container.id where true union all document_b as document left join container_b as container on document.container = container.id where document.property5 is null or document.property5 = 'target' ) Thus returning all entities of the first union element and the entities of the second union element where the property property5 is null or target. Another option is to refer to the type containing the property not by its alias but by its type name, thus guarding the property implicitly: implicitly guarding a reference unionSearchService.where() .alias(\"document_b\").field(\"property5\") .equalTo().value(\"target\") .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); Here arveo will preprocess making the assumption that any relational operator where at least one of the operands is a reference to a type that is not part of the current union element (but of another union element) will simply yield false. Since the join document_a as document left join container_a as container on document.container = container.id does not contain the type document_b the condition document_b.property5 = 'target' will be simplified to false in the context of this union element. This will result in the same query as above, where the reference to the property was explicitly guarded with an and operator. Be aware that searches will still fail if a property is referenced that does not exist at all: querying a non existent property // will throw exception unionSearchService.where() .alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property6\") .equalTo().value(\"target\") .holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); Since none of the document types contain a property property6 this query will fail. Additionally, this property can not be guarded not even explicitly: querying a non existent property unionSearchService.where() .not().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property6\").isNull() .and().alias(DOCUMENT).field(\"property6\") .equalTo().value(\"target\").holds().order().stream(200).findFirst(); This query will also fail. Only properties that are valid in at least one element of a union may be guarded. In some situations one needs to accumulate some values that are listed in a database. In SQL this is done using aggregate functions and the group by clause. For example in an invoice archive one might be interested in the number of invoices per customer, or the sum of their totals (per customer). Queries like this can be executed using the aggregated search. As opposed to the other search methods the result entity type of this search method is Map<String, Object>, since aggregating properties will potentially result in a different type - one that might not be specified. Thus, a more general return type is used. To start an aggregated search query, you will need to build a search service for your aggregated search first. We will build a service for the example above: querying the number and total sum of invoices per user. Assume that we have a type customer defined by the class Customer and a type invoice defined by the class Invoice: @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @FilingEnabled public interface Customer { @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) DocumentId id(); @Unique String getName(); void setName(String name); } @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) @FilingEnabled public interface Invoice { @ForeignKey(name = \"fk_invoice_customer\", target = Customer.class, targetProperty = \"id\") long getCustomerNumber(); void setCustomerNumber(long number); @Optional String getCustomerName(); void setCustomerName(String customerName); @Optional String getName(); void setName(String name); @Optional Integer getTotal(); void setTotal(Integer total); @Optional Boolean getOpen(); void setOpen(Boolean open); } As you can see, the invoice references the customer with the property customer_number defined by the method getCustomerNumber(). Now we can build a search service as follows: final EcrSearchService<Map<String, Object>> aggregationSearchService = searchClient.aggregate() (1) .count(\"i\", \"id\").as(\"invoice_count\") (2) .sum(\"i\", \"total\").as(\"invoice_total\") .groupedBy(\"c\", \"name\").as(\"customer\") .from().type(ProtectedInvoice.class).as(\"i\").join().type(ProtectedCustomer.class).as(\"c\") (3) .on().alias(\"i\").field(\"customer_number\").equalTo().alias(\"c\").id() (4) .holds().build(); 1 Calling SearchClient.aggregate() is the entry point to the fluent api to build a search service for aggregation search requests. 2 At first, we need to specify what to aggregate and what to group by: In our case we want to get the count (of the invoice ids) and the sum of the invoice totals grouped by customer name (which is unique). Every field that is grouped by will also be part of the result. 3 Now we need to specify from where the data to aggregate comes from. We join the type Invoice with the type Customer. Note that we specify aliases for the types \"i\" and \"c\", which we used in the step before to reference the types fields. 4 Now we specify the condition for the join. The condition is that the invoices customer_number must equal the customers' id - as the foreign key fk_invoice_customer above specifies. Now we can query for the aggregated data: final List<Map<String, Object>> all = aggregationSearchService.where().alwaysTrue().holds().unpaged(); This will result in a list of maps - one map per customer - where every map contains the keys \"customer\", \"invoice_count\" and \"invoice_total\". Holding the customers name, the number of their invoices and their total sum, respectively´. Additionally, we can query specific customers and invoices using the same search service. In this scenario for example we could query every customers \"invoice_count\" and \"invoice_total\" of invoices that are open i.e. that they haven’t paid, yet: final List<Map<String, Object>> open = aggregationSearchService.where() .alias(\"i\").field(\"open\").equalTo().value(true) .holds().unpaged(); This will also result in a list of maps - one map per customer - where every map contains the keys \"customer\", \"invoice_count\" and \"invoice_total\". Holding the customers name, the number of their invoices and their total sum, respectively´ - only counting open invoices. Note that we can reference the invoices field open by using the alias i we provided earlier, even though it is not part of the result.","title":"Search language","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"search-service","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/search-service.html","titles":[{"text":"Concept","hash":"_search_service","id":1},{"text":"Technical implementation","hash":"technical_implementation","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":3},{"text":"Search endpoints","hash":"search_endpoints","id":4},{"text":"Union Search and Reference Evaluation","hash":"union_search_and_reference_evaluation","id":5},{"text":"Filtering with conditions","hash":"filtering_with_conditions","id":6},{"text":"Explicit Guards","hash":"explicit_guards","id":7},{"text":"Implicit Guards","hash":"implicit_guards","id":8},{"text":"Aggregation searches","hash":"aggregation_searches","id":9}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"This archetype creates a rather small project.

Also, you have to remember, that this will generate a project structure into a project folder. So before you type this command in your command line, make sure you have prepared a folder where your project structure is going to be and you have switched into this folder on your command line. This will start a process that will ask for some parameters and then generate a maven project according to the parameters. The following parameters will be asked for: groupId The maven groupId of the new project artifactId The maven artifactId of the new project version The maven version of the new project class-name-prefix A prefix for the names of the generated classes. scm-locator The location in the eitco bitbucket server where the sources are (or will be). For a project located in https://git.eitco.de/scm/<project>/<repository>.git, this would be <project>/<repository>.git. This configures the maven release plugin. If this is omitted (or set to a wrong value) the project will work for now - however the release process will not work - unless it is fixed. Some or all of these parameters can also be given on the commandline via -D. The process will not ask for parameters given by command line.

The project generated by the archetype will consist of two modules: This module contains your arveo scenario. An example type will be created with the name <class-name-prefix>Model. You can define more types here, but you will need to register them in register in <class-name-prefix>TypeRegistration. The chapter arveo type definitions describes how to define types. This module contains tests for your scenario. These tests will be executed in the build. For that a complete arveo environment will be created, so you can add tests, that simply connect to arveo by the http client and can assume that your scenario is deployed. This module can also be used to set up an arveo environment with your scenario on which you can then run tests manually. In the module run mvn -Denv to set up the environment.

There are different types of system properties: General system properties: system properties that are available on all types of entity (except for meta data entities). General system properties: system properties that are available on all types of entity (except for meta data entities). Versioned entity system properties: system properties that are only available on entities that can be versioned (Containers, Documents, Folders, Relations). Those properties are contained in the main table of a type definition. Document system properties: system properties that are only available on documents. Folder system properties: system properties that are only available on folders. Relation system properties: system properties that are only available on relations. Version system properties: system properties that are only available on versions of entities. Those properties are contained in the version table of a type definition. All system columns in the database are snake case but not camel case. e.g. the Java RetentionDate variable is persisted as \"retention_date\". General system properties: Name Database Type Description id bigint The unique identifier of the entity. Use EcrId properties (or subclasses as applicable). Can be used on any entity and is applied by arveo for all types but metadata. creation_date datetime GMT timestamp when the entity or version was created, precision (1/1000 second) creator_user_id bigint The ID of the user who created the entity or version deleted boolean Optional flag that indicates that an entity is currently contained in the recycle bin. last_delete_restore_date datetime Optional GMT timestamp of when the entity was last moved in or out of the recycle bin. retention_date datetime The GMT based retention timestamp defines the minimum storage date i.e. the related object can not be deleted until after this date passed. Cannot be used on meta data entities and is only available on entity types that declared to be retention protected (Retention) litigation_hold boolean The boolean indicates whether a document is related to a litigation. If the flag is set the document must never be deleted - even if the retention date has passed by. Cannot be used on meta data entites and is only available on entity types that declared to be retention protected (Retention) update_counter int Optional counter for the number of updates on an entity used for optimistic locking. Versioned entity system properties: Name Database Type Description version_number bigint The sequential number of the latest version of the versioned entity. latest_version_id bigint The unique identifier of the latest version of the entity. version_comment string A comment set by the client when a new version is created. modification_date datetime GMT timestamp when the version was created or changed, precision (1/1000 second) modification_user_id bigint The ID of the user who created or changed the version initial_creation_date datetime GMT timestamp of when the first version of an entity was created. initial_creation_user_id bigint The ID of the user who created the first version of the entity. Document system properties: Name Database Type Description content json JSON containing content properties: ID : unique id of the content Hash : SHA256 hash of the content stream Hash-Algorithm: Algorithm of the hash MediaType : mime type of the content, e.g. octet-stream Creation: GMT based ZonedDateTime timestamp of the creation of the object FileName: Name of the file, if stored on a file system storage Size: bigint value containing the size of the content stream in bytes parent_id bigint Optional field that contains the ID of the folder the document is contained in. Folder system properties: Name Database Type Description folder_name String The name of the folder. parent_id bigint The ID of the parent of the folder in the folder tree. Relation system properties: Name Database Type Description parent_id bigint The id of the parent of this relation. parent_version_id bigint The version-id of the parent of this relation. Can only be used on relation types that support relations to or from versions. child_id bigint The id of the child of this relation. child_version_id bigint The version-id of the child of this relation. Can only be used on relation types that support relations to or from versions. Version system properties: Name Database Type Description version_number bigint The sequential number of the version. version_id bigint The unique identifier of the version. version_comment string A comment set by the client when a new version is created. entity_id bigint The ID of the entity the version belongs to. All timestamp system properties (creation_date, initial_creation_date, modification_date) are stored in the database using the GMT timezone and a precision of 1 millisecond. When using the Java API, the values will be returned as ZonedDateTime instances. The initial_creation_date field will contain the timestamp of when the very first version of an entity was created. This field is never updated. The creation_date field on the other hand will contain the time a specific version of an entity was created. Thus, the creation_date field in the main table will be updated when a new version is created because the main table will always contain the latest version of an entity. The modification timestamp field (modification_date) will contain the timestamp of when a version was created or overwritten. This field, too, will be updated in the main table each time a new version is created. It will be updated in the main table and in the version table when a version gets overwritten.","title":"System Properties","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"system-fields","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/system-fields.html","titles":[{"text":"System Property Names","hash":"system_property_names","id":1},{"text":"Timestamps","hash":"timestamps","id":2}]},"64":{"id":64,"text":"This section contains information about the system tables used by arveo.

By storing the division names in an attribute of the entities, a simple separation by division can be achieved. Another way to separate entities by client is to use one type definition for each tenant. Using inheritance, the type definitions can still share a common set of attributes. To decide which type definition(s) a user is allowed to use can either be made by the integrated type level security mechanism or by a custom service hosting the business logic that is used as a gateway to the arveo services.

Type definitions are described as Java interfaces, which ensures strong typing of attributes. Furthermore, constraints like @Mandatory can be added to attributes to ensure consistency on the database level. Advanced validation can be implemented using the @Validated and @ValidatedBy annotations as shown in the following chapters. The validation is performed on the server side before the entity is persisted in the database. Validation expressions and validation methods have access to the attributes present in the input sent to the server. Inherited attributes or attribute values of the previous version already persisted in the database are not available in this stage. The @Validated annotation allows to define validation expressions using the Spring Expression Language (SpEL). This is the recommended way to perform simple validations like checking the range of a numeric attribute or if a string matches a regular expression. Null- or length-checks should be implemented using database constraints. For very complex validations, that might require debugging, the @ValidatedBy annotation described below should be used. The @Validated annotation is placed on an attribute getter and requires an expression parameter. An optional error message can be defined, which will be presented to the client in case the validation has failed and a ValidationException is thrown. The entered SpEL expressions are evaluated on the server side. In each evaluation, the expression has access to two variables: #value: The actual value of the attribute. Might be null if no value was entered. #attributes: A Map<String,Object> containing all attribute values. SpEL supports calling methods on java objects, so all available methods of the value’s class can be used for validation. Static methods of other classes can be called using a type expression like T(<class>).method(). In the following example, a regular expression is used to check if the entered value is a valid german license plate: using regular expressions for validation @Mandatory (1) @Validated( expression = \"#value.matches('[A-Z]{1,3}\\\\s[A-Z]{1,2}\\\\s\\\\d{1,4}[E,H]*')\", (2) errorMessage = \"$attributeName$ $attributeValue$ is not a valid license plate\" (3) ) String getLicensePlate(); 1 A database constraint is used to ensure a value is entered 2 The entered value is matched using a regular expression 3 The error message used in case the validation has failed The next example shows how to use the static now() method of the ZonedDateTime class to perform a date comparison: using static methods @Mandatory @Validated( expression = \"#value.isBefore(T(java.time.ZonedDateTime).now())\", (1) errorMessage = \"Date of purchase must be in the past.\" ) ZonedDateTime getDateOfPurchase(); 1 A type expression is used to get access to the ZonedDateTime class and the instance method isBefore is used for the comparison. It is also possible to write validation expressions that depend on the values of other attributes. In the following example, a value must be entered when the value of another attribute is false: referencing other attributes @Optional (1) @Validated( expression = \"#attributes.get('available') && #value == null || !#attributes.get('available') && #value != null\", (2) errorMessage = \"$attributeName$ must be set when car is not available\" ) ZonedDateTime getLeaseStartDate(); 1 The value is optional, so no database constraint enforces a non-null value 2 If the value for available is false, the entered value must not be null Complex validations can get difficult to handle when written as a SpEL expression. For such use cases, the @ValidatedBy annotation can be used to define that a static method of the type definition interface will be used for the validation. Validation methods must be static, return a nullable String and accept three parameters in the following declaration order: Object value: The value of the attribute to validate String attributeName: The name of the attribute to validate Map<String, Object> attributes: The values of all attributes Each validation method must be annotated using @ValidationMethod. The returned string is used as error message for the client when the validation has failed. Returning null means that the validation was successful. The following example shows the same scenario as in the last example for the @Validated annotation: When the value of the available attribute is false, a non-null value for the attribute must be entered. validation method @ValidationMethod static String validateLeaseEndDate( Object value, String attributeName, Map<String, Object> attributes ) { if (Objects.equals(Boolean.TRUE, attributes.get(\"available\"))) { if (value != null) { return \"lease_end_date must not be set when car is available\"; } } if (Objects.equals(Boolean.FALSE, attributes.get(\"available\"))) { if (value == null) { return \"lease_end_date must be set when car is not available\"; } } return null; } The validation method is referenced on the attribute getter using the @ValidatedBy annotation: referencing a validation method @ValidatedBy(\"validateLeaseEndDate\") @Optional ZonedDateTime getLeaseEndDate();","title":"Validation","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"validation","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/validation.html","titles":[{"text":"Using @Validated","hash":"using_validated","id":1},{"text":"Writing validation SpEL expressions","hash":"writing_validation_spel_expressions","id":2},{"text":"Examples","hash":"examples","id":3},{"text":"Using @ValidatedBy","hash":"using_validatedby","id":4},{"text":"Writing validation methods","hash":"writing_validation_methods","id":5}]},"67":{"id":67,"text":"The goal of using the concept of versioning is to create and work with version-safe archives and track the history of each change in the system. All entity types in arveo may have a version, which itself is an optional attribute. The attributes of the entity types specify in their definition whether they are versioned. If an entity type has at least one versioned attribute, a version table is created. The version number of an existing entity is automatically created and can be retrieved via the system property version_number. In the version table, the version changes to the metadata are listed, as well as the changes to one or more content elements. Optionally you can specify a Unicode version comment. Each version gets a version ID, which is unique for this bundle of version tables. The version id allows a developer to retrieve content and metadata of exactly this version of the entity. Using the API a developer can query all versions including their metadata and content elements for each entity ID or version ID. It is ensured that the existing content of a version is not changed or deleted by a new version, but there is an exception to this rule, which does allow to overwrite a version change. There is a function that allows you to make a change without having to note it in the version table. And there is a way to forbid this for a certain entity type. The concept of versioning is implemented using the annotation @Versioned, which is defined by the interface Versioned. This annotation defines if an attribute of a type is versioned or not (when placed on a getter) or if all attributes of a type are versioned or not (when placed on a type). When the annotation is present on a type and on a getter in the type, the annotation on the getter wins. The following example of an object of type Container contains an attribute \"name\", which is a versioned attribute. The other attribute \"counter\" in this example is marked as not versioned. Example: @Type(ObjectType.CONTAINER) @OverwriteAllowed public interface TypedSourceContainer { @Name(\"counter\") @Versioned(false) int getCounter(); @Name(\"name\") @Versioned String getName(); } The actual search table only contains the current status of metadata and system fields. In the version table, however, all entities and their versions including the metadata are listed. Only versioned attributes are included in the version table. A current internal version counter (1.,2…​n) is maintained in the system column version_number. During versioning the service counts up the internal version counter by incrementing the value of the system column version_number by 1. The value is stored in the version table. Changes to non-versioned fields cannot be tracked because they are not written to the version table. To prevent accidental overwriting of such fields, optimistic locking can be activated. In this case, a certain property is defined to let the system know, a certain version of an entity is outdated. Activating the optimistic locking prevents overwriting for versioned fields. When simultaneously editing an entity and trying to overwrite saved changes of another user, an error message is thrown. Overwriting is not thus possible. Hence, through activating the optimistic locking on an entity type definition (using the annotation @OptimisticLocking), you prevent data corruption. Optimistic locking is used only for single updates, not for batch updates. The version system table consists of the following columns (this is not a complete excerpt): Structure of the system table column db data type java data type nullable? version_id bigserial long no entity_id int8 long yes modification_date timestamp ZonedDateTime no modification_user_id int8 long no version_comment text String yes version_number int4 int no In this table, version_id is the primary key. The foreign key entity_id references the corresponding entity table. The version ID has the following structure: [12bit System id][14bit Type Definition id][38bit Version id] The system ID is an internal requirement. It is followed by a type definition ID. The third part is the version id in the database. The composed version id is unique in arveo system.","title":"Versioning","component":"arveo-docu","version":"22.0.4","name":"versioning","url":"/arveo-docu/22.0.4/arveo-developer/versioning.html","titles":[{"text":"Versioning basics","hash":"versioning_basics","id":1},{"text":"Implementation of versioning","hash":"implementation_of_versioning","id":2},{"text":"Data model for versioning","hash":"data_model_for_versioning","id":3},{"text":"Optimistic locking","hash":"optimistic_locking","id":4},{"text":"Structure of the version system table","hash":"structure_of_the_version_system_table","id":5},{"text":"Version ID","hash":"version_id","id":6}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"In this guide you will create a simple application that implements a basic project file scenario. It will consist of a document type, that represents documents used in a project. To complete the steps in this guide, you need the following tools installed on your machine: JDK 21 (https://adoptium.net). Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org) An IDE of your choice (we recommend IntelliJ) To be able to access the maven artifacts of arveo, you need access to the EITCO Nexus repository. When you are inside the company network or the VPN, you can use the internal Nexus that does not require authentication. The following maven settings.xml file shows how to configure the required repositories. The settings.xml file can be found in the .m2 directory in your user home directory. <settings xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd\"> <pluginGroups> </pluginGroups> <proxies> </proxies> <servers> </servers> <mirrors> </mirrors> <profiles> <profile> <id>repos-default</id> <activation> <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault> </activation> <properties> </properties> <repositories> <repository> (1) <id>nexus</id> <url>https://nexus-intern.eitco.de/repository/maven-private/</url> <releases> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </releases> <snapshots> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </snapshots> </repository> </repositories> <pluginRepositories> <pluginRepository> (2) <id>nexus</id> <url>https://nexus-intern.eitco.de/repository/maven-private/</url> <releases> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </releases> <snapshots> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </snapshots> </pluginRepository> </pluginRepositories> </profile> </profiles> </settings> 1 The maven repository that contains maven artifacts of arveo 2 The plugin repository that contains maven plugins used when building the demo project When you are outside the company network and the VPN, you need to use the public Nexus repository that requires authentication. To do so, maven requires credentials. For security reasons, the credentials should be encrypted. Follow the instructions in the Maven documentation to configure a master password and to create an encrypted password. You should now have created a settings-security.xml file in the .m2 directory like the one shown below: <settingsSecurity> <master>{encryped-master-password}</master> </settingsSecurity> Then you have to adapt your maven settings.xml as follows: Depending on the access rights of your user for the Nexus server, you might not have access to the maven-private repository used in the configuration below. In this case you must use the maven-ecr repository instead. <settings xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd\"> <pluginGroups> </pluginGroups> <proxies> </proxies> <servers> <server> <id>nexus</id> (1) <username>username</username> (2) <password>{your-encrypted-password}</password> (3) </server> </servers> <mirrors> </mirrors> <profiles> <profile> <id>repos-default</id> <activation> <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault> </activation> <repositories> <repository> <id>nexus</id> (4) <url>https://nexus.eitco.de/repository/maven-private/</url> <releases> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </releases> <snapshots> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </snapshots> </repository> </repositories> <pluginRepositories> <pluginRepository> <id>nexus</id> <url>https://nexus.eitco.de/repository/maven-private/</url> <releases> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </releases> <snapshots> <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy> </snapshots> </pluginRepository> </pluginRepositories> </profile> </profiles> </settings> 1 The server id is used to tie credentials to repositories 2 The username you use to logon to nexus 3 The password encrypted by maven using the master password 4 Tells maven to use the credentials for the server with id 'nexus' Make sure to use only https repositories when using credentials. Current maven versions already block the usage of unencrypted repository connections. In the first step you will define the data model of your application. In arveo, this is done by creating Java (or Kotlin) interfaces which contain getters and setters for the fields that will be available on each individual entity type. There is a maven archetype to create a project that will contain those type definition interfaces and integration tests to try out the created types. More information about the archetype can be found here. First, create a directory that will contain the project files for the demo application. Open a command line in this directory and perform the following operation. mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=de.eitco.ecr -DarchetypeArtifactId=ecr-types-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=22.0.4-SNAPSHOT The archetype version is the arveo version that you are working with. The current version is 22.0.4-SNAPSHOT. Maven will start by downloading a couple of required artifacts. After that, the archetype plugin will be started in interactive mode. It will query for several settings required for the generated project. Some of the settings have default values that can be used. class-name-prefix: A prefix that will be used for the generated classes. Use Demo for this guide. groupId: The group-id of the artifact that will contain the types. Use de.eitco.demo. artifactId: The artifact-id of the artifact that will contain the type. Use demo-types. version: The version of the artifact. You can use the default value. package: The package that will contain the types. You can use the default value. In the last step, the archetype plugin shows the selected property values and asks for confirmation. After the settings are confirmed, the project will be generated in a folder called demo-types. The archetype documentation contains a description of the generated project. For this guide, the files in implementation/types are the most important ones: Document.java: This file contains a type definition interface for the type definition document. Record.java: This file contains a type definition interface for the type definition record. DemoTypeRegistration.java: A spring component that automatically registers your type(s) in the arveo service. Only types that have been registered can be used in your application. org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports: This file tells spring to autoconfigure the DemoRegistration component. The generated model consists of a simple record structure, where a record can contain multiple documents that are linked to the record using a foreign key. The foreign key is defined in the document type definition. The annotations used to define the type definitions are documented here. The archetype has generated integration tests for the generated type definitions, too. You can find them in the directory test/system-test. The file RecordClientIT.java contains some tests that show how to perform basic CRUD operations on the generated types. The tests are run automatically in a full maven build. The system-test module is configured to automatically start a complete arveo system including all required services and a database. If you want to run the tests manually from the IDE, you can still use maven to start the arveo system. Open a command line in the system-test directory and run mvn -Denv. Maven will start the following processes: A PostreSQL database server An ActiveMQ message broker A Keycloak server A Vault server The Service Registry The Configuration Service The arveo Service The services will be kept alive until you press enter in the command line. This will only work if a complete build has been performed at least once (which can be done through mvn install). The system set up by maven in the system test module is already configured to contain the type definitions that were defined in this project. To use those definitions in another system, you have to add the jar containing the definitions to the classpath of the arveo service instances. This can be done by copying the ja to a lib directory and adding the following command line option when starting the arveo service instances: -Dloader.path=path/to/libs Now you can adapt the generated type definition so that it fits the requirements for our project scenario. In this scenario, documents are organized in a two-level folder structure. For example, the project could contain a folder called \"invoices\" which again contains two folders named \"inbound\" and \"outbound\". Each document is contained in exactly one folder and belongs to exactly one project. The document type will contain the following attributes: projectName: The name of the project the documents belongs to type: The type of document, e.g. whether it is an invoice, a contract or something else structureLevel1: This field is used to represent the first level of the folder structure structureLevel2: This field is used to represent the second level of the folder structure status: Represents the current status of the document customerName: The name of the customer associated to the project contactPerson: The contact person for the document assignedTo: The employee currently assigned to work on the document fileSystemCreationDate: The timestamp at which the file was created in the file system (not the time it was imported to arveo - see system fields) In addition to these custom fields, the document will contain some system fields like content metadata (filename, size, mimetype…​) and versioning information like creation- and update-timestamps. The two type definition interfaces generated by the archetype are not required and can be removed. Don’t forget to remove the registrations from DemoTypeRegistration.java and the generated test class RecordClientIT.java. Complete listings for the steps below can be found at the end of this chapter. First, you have to create a new interface for the document type definition used in this project. The interface will be called DemoModel. It will serve both as a type definition and as a model for the REST API, so it has to be annotated with @Model (for the JSON serialization) and @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) (for the type definition). To make the new type definition available in arveo, it has to be registered by adding @Register(DemoModel.class) to DemoTypeRegistration.java. DemoModel.java package de.eitco.demo.types; import de.eitco.commons.asdl.annotation.Model; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.ObjectType; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.Type; @Model @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface DemoModel { } Let’s first add some getters for system fields to DemoModel. Those will provide access to system information that is generated automatically when an entity is created or updated. Add the following lines to DemoModel.java: @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) DocumentId getDocumentId(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CONTENT) Map<String, ContentInformation> getContentInformation(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.VERSION_INFO) VersionInformation getVersionInformation(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.MODIFICATION_INFO) ModificationInformation getModificationInformation(); The JavaDoc for the SystemPropertyName enum constants contains information about each field. The data type for the contentInformation field is a map because each document can contain multiple content elements. For example, a document could contain a TIFF image and a PDF rendition of the TIFF. Now we can add the getters and setters for the custom attributes: @Mandatory String getProjectName(); void setProjectName(String projectName); @Mandatory String getStructureLevel1(); void setStructureLevel1(String structureLevel1); @Optional String getStructureLevel2(); void setStructureLevel2(String structureLevel2); @Optional String getCustomerName(); void setCustomerName(String customerName); @Optional String getContactPerson(); void setContactPerson(String contactPerson); @Mandatory ZonedDateTime getFileSystemCreationDate(); void setFileSystemCreationDate(ZonedDateTime fileSystemCreationDate); @Optional Long getAssignedTo(); void setAssignedTo(Long assignedTo); The annotations @Mandatory and @Optional can be used to control which fields have to be set by the client and which can be left empty. The annotations for the arveo type definitions always have to be added to the getters. You can find an overview of the supported data types here. For the type field we want to limit the possible values that can be set. This can be done by defining an enumeration. Create the following enumeration type: package de.eitco.demo.types; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.Enumeration; @Enumeration public enum DemoModelType { INVOICE, CONTRACT, OTHER } This enum class will be mapped to an enumeration type on the database. It needs to be registered in the type registration just like the DemoModel type. We will do the same for the status field. Add and register the following enum class: @Enumeration public enum DemoModelStatus { IN_PROGRESS, DONE } The class DemoTypeRegistration should now look as follows: DemoTypeRegistration.java package de.eitco.demo.types; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.Register; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.TypeDefinitionRegistration; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration; @AutoConfiguration @Register(DemoModel.class) @Register(DemoModelType.class) @Register(DemoModelStatus.class) public class DemoTypeRegistration implements TypeDefinitionRegistration { } Now you can add the getters and setters for the two fields in the DemoModel class: @Mandatory DemoModelType getType(); void setType(DemoModelType type); @Optional DemoModelStatus getStatus(); void setStatus(DemoModelStatus status); Your DemoModel class should now look like this: package de.eitco.demo.types; import de.eitco.commons.asdl.annotation.AsdlIgnore; import de.eitco.commons.asdl.annotation.Model; import de.eitco.commons.user.management.common.model.ModificationInformation; import de.eitco.ecr.common.ContentInformation; import de.eitco.ecr.common.VersionInformation; import de.eitco.ecr.common.document.DocumentId; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.ObjectType; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.Type; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.constraint.Mandatory; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.constraint.Optional; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.system.SystemProperty; import de.eitco.ecr.type.definition.annotations.system.SystemPropertyName; import java.time.ZonedDateTime; import java.util.Map; @Model @Type(ObjectType.DOCUMENT) public interface DemoModel { @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.ID) DocumentId getDocumentId(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.CONTENT) Map<String, ContentInformation> getContentInformation(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.VERSION_INFO) VersionInformation getVersionInformation(); @SystemProperty(SystemPropertyName.MODIFICATION_INFO) ModificationInformation getModificationInformation(); @Mandatory String getProjectName(); void setProjectName(String projectName); @Mandatory String getStructureLevel1(); void setStructureLevel1(String structureLevel1); @Optional String getStructureLevel2(); void setStructureLevel2(String structureLevel2); @Optional String getCustomerName(); void setCustomerName(String customerName); @Optional String getContactPerson(); void setContactPerson(String contactPerson); @Mandatory ZonedDateTime getFileSystemCreationDate(); void setFileSystemCreationDate(ZonedDateTime fileSystemCreationDate); @Mandatory DemoModelType getType(); void setType(DemoModelType type); @Optional DemoModelStatus getStatus(); void setStatus(DemoModelStatus status); @Optional Long getAssignedTo(); void setAssignedTo(Long assignedTo); } Run mvn clean install to build the project. In the second step you will implement a simple command line application that uses the model defined in step 1. We will use the Spring Initializer to generate a maven project with the required dependencies for a Spring command line application. Go to https://start.spring.io/ Under \"Project\", select \"Maven Project\" Under \"Language\", select \"Java\" Select Spring Boot version 3.4.3. If your required version is not available, select the most compatible one in terms of major.minor.patch. Define project metadata. For example, use Group = de.eitco.demo, Artifact = demo-tool, Name = demo-tool, Package name = de.eitco.demo.tool Select \"Jar\" Packaging Select Java version 21 or newer Add a dependency to \"Spring Shell\" Click Generate and download the zip file containing the generated project. Unzip the file to a directory of your choice and open the project in your IDE. Delete the src/test directory. Open the generated pom.xml file and add the following dependency to the dependency-management section: <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> ... <dependency> (1) <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> <artifactId>ecr-bom</artifactId> <version>22.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> 1 Imports dependency versions for all dependencies required by arveo. The order of the imported BOMs is important. The version of a dependency is defined by the first BOM that manages this dependency. Now you can add the required arveo dependencies to the dependencies section: <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.ecr</groupId> (1) <artifactId>ecr-sdk-http</artifactId> <exclusions> <exclusion> (2) <groupId>de.eitco.commons</groupId> <artifactId>cmn-spring-security5-oauth2-client</artifactId> </exclusion> </exclusions> </dependency> <dependency> (3) <groupId>de.eitco.commons</groupId> <artifactId>cmn-spring-security5-oauth2-client-non-web</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>de.eitco.demo</groupId> (4) <artifactId>demo-types-types</artifactId> <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version> </dependency> 1 This dependency contains a spring boot starter for the arveo SDK 2 We have to exclude the OAuth2 client for web applications because the tool will be a console application 3 This dependency contains the OAuth2 client for non-web applications 4 The data model that was defined in step 1 The arveo version used in the demo-types project must be the same as the version used in the demo-tool project. The tool will use the Spring Shell library to make it easy to write a command line application with features like usage help and simple parameter binding.You can read more about Spring Shell here. At first, you have to configure the Spring application and add a custom shutdown handler so that the application will shut down all background tasks on exit.Add the following class: ShutdownHandler.java package de.eitco.demo.tool; import com.netflix.discovery.DiscoveryManager; import org.springframework.boot.context.event.ApplicationReadyEvent; import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; @Component public class ShutdownHandler { @EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class) public void ready() { (1) DiscoveryManager.getInstance().shutdownComponent(); (2) System.exit(0); (3) } } 1 Register an event listener that will be called when the Spring application shuts down 2 Tell the discovery client used by the arveo SDK to shut down 3 Exit the application Go to the de.eitco.demo.tool package and create a new class called \"ArveoCommand\". This will contain the business logic behind the commands available in the command line application. ArveoCommand.java package de.eitco.demo.tool; import de.eitco.commons.lang.Logger; import org.springframework.shell.standard.ShellComponent; import org.springframework.shell.standard.ShellMethod; import org.springframework.shell.standard.ShellOption; @ShellComponent (1) public class ArveoCommand { private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ArveoCommand.class); (2) private final TypeDefinitionServiceClient typeDefinitionServiceClient; (3) @Autowired public ArveoCommand(TypeDefinitionServiceClient typeDefinitionServiceClient) { this.typeDefinitionServiceClient = typeDefinitionServiceClient; } } 1 Defines ArveoCommand as a command for Spring Shell 2 We will use the de.eitco.commons.lang.Logger to log exception messages 3 The main entry point for the arveo SDK, injected by Spring in the constructor Now it is time to implement the import. Add the following methods to the ArveoCommand class: @ShellMethod(key = \"import\", value = \"import a project\") (1) public void importProjects( @ShellOption(help = \"username for logon\") String username, (2) @ShellOption(help = \"password for logon\") String password, @ShellOption(help = \"name of the customer\") String customer, @ShellOption(help = \"base directory of the projects to import\") String baseDirectory ) { File base = new File(baseDirectory); Arrays.stream(base.listFiles(File::isDirectory)).forEach(root -> { String projectName = root.getName(); Arrays.stream(root.listFiles()).forEach(file -> { if (file.isFile()) { LOGGER.warn(() -> \"Ignored file \" + file); } else { importLevel1(username, password, projectName, customer, file); } }); }); } 1 Marks the method as a command for Spring Shell 2 Required parameters for the command with help text The importProject method will be used to import a project located in the provided root directory. The scenario does not support files located directly in the root of the project, so we will log a warning when we encounter such a file. private void importLevel1(String username, String password, String projectName, String customer, File level1) { String level1Value = level1.getName(); Arrays.stream(level1.listFiles()).forEach(file -> { if (file.isDirectory()) { importLevel2(username, password, projectName, customer, level1Value, file); } else { importFile(username, password, projectName, customer, level1Value, null, file); } }); } The importLevel1 method will collect all files and directories located in the first level of the project structure. Files will be imported directly, directories will be passed to the next importer method. private void importLevel2(String username, String password, String projectName, String customer, String level1Value, File level2) { String level2Value = level2.getName(); Arrays.stream(level2.listFiles()).forEach(file -> { if (file.isDirectory()) { LOGGER.warn(() -> \"Ignoring directory \" + file); } else { importFile(username, password, projectName, customer, level1Value, level2Value, file); } }); } This method collects all files located in the second level of the project structure. We do not support deeper structures, so we log a warning when we encounter a directory below level 2. The method used to actually import data into arveo is shown below: private void importFile(String username, String password, String projectName, String customer, String level1, String level2, File file) { AuthenticationHelper.runAsUser(username, password, () -> { (1) TypedDocumentServiceClient<DemoModel> serviceClient = (2) typeDefinitionServiceClient.getDocumentServiceClient().byClass(DemoModel.class); DemoModel model = serviceClient.createTypeInstance(); (3) model.setProjectName(projectName); model.setStructureLevel1(level1); model.setStructureLevel2(level2); model.setCustomerName(customer); model.setFileSystemCreationDate(ZonedDateTime.ofInstant( Instant.ofEpochMilli(file.lastModified()), ZoneId.systemDefault()) ); DemoModelType type = DemoModelType.OTHER; (4) String fileName = file.getName(); if (fileName.startsWith(DemoModelType.CONTRACT.name())) { type = DemoModelType.CONTRACT; } else if (fileName.startsWith(DemoModelType.INVOICE.name())) { type = DemoModelType.INVOICE; } model.setType(type); try (InputStream stream = Files.newInputStream(file.toPath())) { ContentUpload contentUpload = new ContentUpload(fileName, stream); Map<String, ContentUpload> contentElements = Map.of(\"content\", contentUpload); (5) serviceClient.create(new TypedDocumentInput<>(contentElements, model)); (6) System.out.println(\"Imported file \" + fileName + \" belonging to project \" + projectName); } catch (IOException e) { LOGGER.exception(e); } }); } 1 The AuthenticationHelper takes care of populating spring’s security context with the required credentials. The OAuth2 client will use the provided username and password to retrieve an access token from the authentication service to authenticate the requests to the arveo service. 2 We use the injected TypeDefinitionServiceClient to get a service client for the type definition of our model class. 3 The service client can provide an instance of the interface defining the model. This instance is then populated with the metadata. 4 We will use a simple file name prefix to determine the type of the document. 5 Here we define the content elements of the new document 6 Finally, we send the create request to the arveo service When you start the application again and type help in the CLI, you will see that our new import command is listed. Typing help import will show information about the command’s parameters. Now you have to add configuration parameters. You can copy the entire spring.security section from the file test/system-test/src/test/resource-templates/application-test.yaml in the demo-types project generated earlier in this guide. Replace the ${keycloak.port} variable with the actual value defined in the pom.xml of the system-test module of demo-types (by default 8180). spring: security: oauth2: client: registration: keycloak-password: (1) provider: keycloak client-id: \"testclient\" client-secret: \"yx7n6di3kXZ4p3Kj2oY1Js9NW7hbOCjh\" authorization-grant-type: \"password\" scope: openid provider: keycloak: issuer-uri: \"http://localhost:8180/realms/TestRealm\" (2) eureka: client: registerWithEureka: false (3) logging: (4) file: name: \"demo-tool.log\" level: root: ERROR 1 Configures an OAuth2 client that uses the resource owner password grant type. Client-id and secret are configured in the test system provided by the system test module of the project created in step 1. 2 Tells the OAuth2 client where to find the Keycloak instance for autoconfiguration. 3 Do not register this application in the service registry 4 Log only errors to a file In the last step, you have to edit the generated DemoToolApplication class and exclude a Spring autoconfiguration that would cause a conflict with the Oauth2 configuration of the arveo SDK. It is also required to configure the application as a non-web application: DemoToolApplication.java package de.eitco.demo.tool; import org.springframework.boot.WebApplicationType; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration; import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder; @SpringBootApplication(exclude = ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration.class) (1) public class DemoToolApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { new SpringApplicationBuilder(DemoToolApplication.class) .web(WebApplicationType.NONE) (2) .run(args); } } 1 Exclude autoconfiguration for OAuth2 for reactive web applications 2 Tell Spring that this is not a web application Now we can build and run the command line tool. You can either use the IDE or run mvn clean install in a command line for the project containing the demo tool. After the build has finished, you have to start the test system. Open a command line in the system-test module of the demo-types project and execute the command mvn -Denv (see Running the tests). Now we can use another command line in the target directory of the command line tool project to run the tool. Running java -jar .\\demo-tool-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar will start the tool. Typing help in the CLI will show all available commands. Typing help import will show help about the import command.  java -jar .\\demo-tool-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . ____ _ __ _ _ /\\\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __ __ _ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( ( )\\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \\/ _` | \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\\/ ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| | ) ) ) ) ' |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\\__, | / / / / =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/ :: Spring Boot :: (v3.2.3) shell:>help import NAME import - import a project SYNOPSIS import [--username String] [--password String] [--customer String] [--baseDirectory String] --help OPTIONS --username String username for logon [Mandatory] --password String password for logon [Mandatory] --customer String name of the customer [Mandatory] --baseDirectory String base directory of the project to import [Mandatory] --help or -h help for import [Optional] Finally, here is a complete listing of the ArveoCommand class for copy&paste: package de.eitco.demo.tool;

Your project structure must have a certain layout to be successfully imported and archived in arveo. Figure 1. Required project structure Here is an example of implementing this structure: Figure 2. Examplary project structure The test system already contains a user that can be used for testing. The user’s credentials are: username: integration-test password: password To import all projects in the folder, type import --username integration-test --password password --customer Mycustomer --baseDirectory C:/path/Projects The import tool will print a message for each imported file.","title":"Getting
